//! `LedgerEngine` trait surface.
//!
//! Per [`docs/V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md`] §2.2, `LedgerEngine` is
//! the wallet-side trait that owns the confirmed-chain ledger:
//! `LedgerBlock` (the chain projection scanned out of daemon blocks),
//! the matured-output index, the balance projection, and the
//! transfer history. It is the reservation-agnostic half of the
//! wallet's spendable-state surface; the spendable-balance projection
//! that subtracts in-flight `PendingTx` reservations lives on
//! `PendingTxEngine` (§2.6) per the Round 3 ownership decision.
//!
//! # Round 3 disposition: `&self` over `&mut self`
//!
//! The trait's mutating method [`LedgerEngine::apply_scan_result`]
//! takes `&self`, not `&mut self`, because Stage 1's default
//! implementing type `LocalLedger` carries
//! `RwLock<LedgerState>` for interior mutability. The trait would
//! otherwise force every reader/writer in `Engine` to hold an
//! exclusive borrow across an `await`, which conflicts with the
//! `Arc<…>` clone-and-share pattern that `tokio::spawn` uses to
//! schedule the producer task in `run_refresh_task`. The lock is
//! acquired internally by the implementor; the trait surface
//! exposes the `&self` shape uniformly to callers.
//!
//! # Stage-4 swap-in (§7)
//!
//! At Stage 4 the `LedgerEngine` bound is satisfied by an
//! `ActorRef<LedgerActor>` rather than by the in-process
//! [`LocalLedger`] wrapping `RwLock<LedgerState>`. Trait method
//! signatures do not change; only the implementor type does.
//! Callers that bind against `L: LedgerEngine` get the swap-in
//! for free.
//!
//! # Reservation tracker placement
//!
//! Per the §2.2 / §2.6 amendment landed in PR #22, the
//! `PendingReservations` tracker is owned by [`PendingTxEngine`],
//! not [`LedgerEngine`]. [`LedgerEngine::balance`] returns the
//! reservation-agnostic [`BalanceSummary`] computed from
//! `LedgerBlock` alone; the spendable-balance projection that
//! subtracts in-flight reservations lives on `PendingTxEngine`
//! (§2.6 surface, lands in PR 6). The split keeps `LedgerEngine`
//! identifiable as the §1.5 actor that owns confirmed-chain state
//! and lets `PendingTxEngine` own all reservation lifecycle in one
//! place.
//!
//! # `BalanceSummary` over `Balance` (Phase 0b)
//!
//! [`LedgerEngine::balance`] returns [`BalanceSummary`] (the
//! `shekyl_scanner` aggregate the codebase uses today: `confirmed`,
//! `pending`, `total`), not a `Balance` newtype. Per the §2.2
//! Phase 0b amendment landed in PR #23, the `BalanceSummary`-vs-
//! `Balance` rename is a §7 out-of-scope follow-up; PR 2 takes the
//! existing aggregate as-is to keep the trait extraction small and
//! reviewable.

/// # Supertrait bounds
///
/// - `Send + Sync + 'static` — `LedgerEngine` instances are shared
///   across the orchestration future and the producer task in
///   `run_refresh_task`'s `tokio::spawn`'d future, typically as
///   `Arc<L>`. `LocalLedger` (Stage 1) and `ActorRef<LedgerActor>`
///   (Stage 4) both satisfy these bounds; `Arc<RwLock<…>>` is
///   `Send + Sync` whenever its contents are.
/// - **Not** `Clone` — unlike [`DaemonEngine`], `LedgerEngine`
///   instances wrap `RwLock<…>` (or, at Stage 4, an `ActorRef`)
///   and are shared by `Arc`, not by clone. Implementors that
///   need a clone for refresh-task scheduling clone the `Arc`
///   wrapper, not the trait object.
