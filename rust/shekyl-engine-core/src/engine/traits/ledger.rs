//! `LedgerEngine` trait surface.
//!
//! Per [`docs/V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md`] §2.2, `LedgerEngine` is
//! the wallet-side trait that owns the confirmed-chain ledger:
//! `LedgerBlock` (the chain projection scanned out of daemon blocks),
//! the matured-output index, and the balance projection. It is the
//! reservation-agnostic half of the wallet's spendable-state surface;
//! the spendable-balance projection that subtracts in-flight
//! `PendingTx` reservations lives on `PendingTxEngine` (§2.6) per
//! the Round 3 ownership decision. Per-transaction history is read
//! directly from the underlying `LedgerBlock` rather than through
//! the trait — see the Phase 0c section below.
//!
//! # Round 3 disposition: `&self` over `&mut self`
//!
//! The trait's mutating method [`LedgerEngine::apply_scan_result`]
//! takes `&self`, not `&mut self`, because Stage 1's default
//! implementing type `LocalLedger` carries
//! `RwLock<LedgerState>` for interior mutability. The trait would
//! otherwise force every reader/writer in `Engine` to hold an
//! exclusive borrow across an `await`, which conflicts with the
//! `Arc<…>` clone-and-share pattern that `tokio::spawn` uses to
//! schedule the producer task in `run_refresh_task`. The lock is
//! acquired internally by the implementor; the trait surface
//! exposes the `&self` shape uniformly to callers.
//!
//! # Stage-4 swap-in (§7)
//!
//! At Stage 4 the `LedgerEngine` bound is satisfied by an
//! `ActorRef<LedgerActor>` rather than by the in-process
//! [`LocalLedger`] wrapping `RwLock<LedgerState>`. Trait method
//! signatures do not change; only the implementor type does.
//! Callers that bind against `L: LedgerEngine` get the swap-in
//! for free.
//!
//! # Reservation tracker placement
//!
//! Per the §2.2 / §2.6 amendment landed in PR #22, the
//! `PendingReservations` tracker is owned by `PendingTxEngine`,
//! not [`LedgerEngine`]. [`LedgerEngine::balance`] returns the
//! reservation-agnostic [`BalanceSummary`] computed from
//! `LedgerBlock` alone; the spendable-balance projection that
//! subtracts in-flight reservations lives on `PendingTxEngine`
//! (§2.6 surface, lands in PR 6). The split keeps `LedgerEngine`
//! identifiable as the §1.5 actor that owns confirmed-chain state
//! and lets `PendingTxEngine` own all reservation lifecycle in one
//! place.
//!
//! # `BalanceSummary` over `Balance` (Phase 0b)
//!
//! [`LedgerEngine::balance`] returns [`BalanceSummary`] (the
//! `shekyl_scanner` aggregate the codebase uses today: `confirmed`,
//! `pending`, `total`), not a `Balance` newtype. Per the §2.2
//! Phase 0b amendment landed in PR #23, the `BalanceSummary`-vs-
//! `Balance` rename is a §7 out-of-scope follow-up; PR 2 takes the
//! existing aggregate as-is to keep the trait extraction small and
//! reviewable.
//!
//! # No `transfers()` trait method (Phase 0c)
//!
//! Per the §2.2 Phase 0c amendment landed in PR #25, the trait
//! surface does **not** include a `transfers()` method.
//! `TransferDetails` is deliberately non-`Clone` per the privacy/
//! security discipline pinned at
//! `rust/shekyl-engine-state/src/transfer.rs` (cloning would
//! duplicate `Zeroizing<[u8; N]>` secrets into a heap allocation
//! the compiler cannot track). A `fn transfers(&self) ->
//! Vec<TransferDetails>` ownership-transfer signature is therefore
//! unsatisfiable without breaking that discipline; per
//! `.cursor/rules/00-mission.mdc` priority 1 ("security and
//! quantum resilience are preconditions"), the trait method is
//! removed rather than the discipline relaxed. Wallet-internal
//! callers consume the `LedgerBlock::transfers(&self) ->
//! &[TransferDetails]` slice accessor directly (the borrow is
//! `Clone`-discipline-respecting by construction); a future
//! Stage 4 actor consumer that needs trait-level enumeration can
//! re-introduce the surface via a non-secret view type designed
//! against its concrete threat model.
//!
//! [`docs/V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md`]: ../../../../../docs/V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md
//! [`LocalLedger`]: super::super::local_ledger::LocalLedger
//! [`BalanceSummary`]: shekyl_scanner::BalanceSummary
//!
//! `PendingTxEngine` is referenced as plain code (not as an
//! intra-doc link) because the type does not yet exist in this
//! workspace; it lands in a future per-trait PR per §2.6 of the
//! contract document. References below render as backticked code
//! rather than rustdoc links until that PR is merged.
