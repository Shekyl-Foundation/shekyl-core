//! RandomX v2 [`VmState`] — the per-hash transient state owned
//! internally by `compute_hash` (the free function landed by commit 6
//! of the same Phase 2c implementation PR).
//!
//! Per
//! [`RANDOMX_V2_PHASE2C_PLAN.md`](../../../docs/design/RANDOMX_V2_PHASE2C_PLAN.md)
//! §2 surface 3 + §3 module layout + §5.1.1 frozen `VmState` field
//! set, this module lands across three Phase 2c implementation-PR
//! commits:
//!
//! - **Commit 4 (this commit, as corrected by the R0-D9 fix-up
//!   immediately on top):** [`VmState`] struct skeleton with the
//!   frozen field set (per §5.1.1 + §5.5 F5 v2-only simplification),
//!   the [`F128`] / [`Instruction`] / [`Program`] type definitions,
//!   the [`PROGRAM_SIZE`] / [`PROGRAM_ITERATIONS`] /
//!   [`RANDOMX_SCRATCHPAD_L3`] spec constants, [`VmState::new`]
//!   (allocation-only constructor), the `alloc_zeroed_scratchpad`
//!   carve-out (Phase 2c's second and final `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`
//!   carve-out per §1 covenant 7 + §5.11.2), the scratchpad-
//!   allocation `debug_assert!` per §5.11.2, and the empty [`Drop`]
//!   (review-surface hook per §5.11.4). No `compute_hash`, no
//!   `dispatch_instruction`, no register/program init — those land
//!   in commits 5 and 6.
//! - **Commit 5 (planned, per §14 Round 0 R0-D8 Rust-idiomatic
//!   two-method init shape):** `VmState::init_scratchpad` via
//!   `aes::fill_aes_1r_x4`, plus `VmState::init_program` (stack-

//!   `128 + 8 * RANDOMX_PROGRAM_SIZE` budget, fill via
//!   `aes::fill_aes_4r_x4`, parse entropy[0..128] into register-init
//!   fields, parse instructions[128..3200] into
//!   `self.program.instructions`), plus T3'/T4'/T5' fixture-free

//! - **Commit 6 (planned):** `pub fn compute_hash` + the private

//!
//! # Threat-model disposition (per §5.11.4)
//!
//! The [`scratchpad`] field is **public-input-only**: every byte is a
//! deterministic function of `(seedhash, block_header)`, both of which
//! are public by construction (block-header field + chain-tip pinned
//! seedhash). No constant-time discipline applies to access patterns
//! over scratchpad memory, and no wipe-on-drop is load-bearing for
//! confidentiality. The empty [`Drop`] impl below exists as a
//! review-surface hook for future field additions that *would* carry
//! secret material (e.g., a hypothetical `ledger_session_secret`
//! field) — landing zeroization inside an already-present [`Drop`]
//! body, not requiring a future contributor to remember to add the
//! impl, is the architectural shape `35-secure-memory.mdc`'s
//! continuous-discipline corollary names.
