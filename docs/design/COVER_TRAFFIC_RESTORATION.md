# Cover traffic restoration — audit, plan, and status

**Status: audit complete, plan pending, implementation not started.**

This document exists because the cover mechanism is **deliberately inert, fully
built, and has no production caller** — which is indistinguishable, to a
dead-code sweep or a new maintainer, from abandoned scaffolding. It is not.
`DAEMON_RELAY_PRIVACY.md` §42 is a standing restoration proposal with a ruled
architecture (§42.3), a ruled backstop (§92), and a scoped implementation
(§42.5a/b).

> **DO NOT DELETE ANY COMPONENT IN §1 ON "NO CALLERS" GROUNDS.** The absence of
> a production caller is *the current state of a two-line configuration
> decision* (§1.1), not evidence of abandonment. The deletion criteria that
> would actually justify removing this machinery are stated in §1.5, and none
> of them is "grep found no callers".

## 1. The audit — every component, and why each has no production caller

### 1.1 The mechanism is inert at exactly TWO points

Everything else in this document is live, compiled, tested code that simply
never executes in the shipped configuration. The inertness is entirely produced
by:

1. **The notifier is constructed with a null covert payload**, at both sites —
   `net_node.inl` public zone and anonymity zone. The third `notify{}` ctor
   argument is `epee::byte_slice noise`, passed as `nullptr`. That empties
   `detail::zone::covert_payload`, and the zone is built as
   `make_relay_zone(zone, !covert_payload.empty())` — so **Rust is told covert
   is off**, and `CovertSchedule` correctly has no deadlines.
2. **`disable_noise` is accepted and ignored** (`net_node.cpp`), with a
   `MWARNING` telling the operator the flag has no effect because covert
   channels are off by default. There is deliberately **no flag to turn them
   on** — §41's deletion removed configuration B, and the comment at that site
   records why turning it back on naively would be wrong.

**Restoring cover traffic is, mechanically, changing (1).** Everything below is
what that change would wake up.

### 1.2 C++ inventory

| component | file | state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `detail::zone::covert_payload` | `levin_notify.cpp` | built; empty in production |
| `detail::zone::channels` (per-channel strands) | `levin_notify.cpp` | built; sized from `CRYPTONOTE_NOISE_CHANNELS` |
| `queue_covert_notify` | `levin_notify.cpp` | complete; posts a covert send to a channel's strand |
| `clear_channel` | `levin_notify.cpp` | complete; nils the binding at an unbound due tick |
| `send_noise` | `levin_notify.cpp` | complete; **owns CV-1's rebind-at-send discard** — the single discard site |
| the covert branch in `send_txs` | `levin_notify.cpp` | complete **and wrong** — see §1.4 |
| `shekyl_relay_zone_covert_enabled` | FFI, called from `levin_notify.cpp` | live call, always returns false today |
| `CRYPTONOTE_NOISE_{MIN_EPOCH,EPOCH_RANGE,MIN_DELAY,DELAY_RANGE,BYTES,CHANNELS}` | `cryptonote_config.h` | six constants, all consumed |

### 1.3 Rust inventory

| component | file | state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CovertSchedule` | `shekyl-relay/src/zone/mod.rs` | **one type so "enabled" and "has deadlines" cannot disagree**; channel `i` bound to stem slot `i` (§20.3) |
| `Zone::covert_deadline` / `due_covert_channel` / `covert_deadline_at` / `covert_enabled` | same | complete |
| `inherited::NOISE_CHANNELS` mirror | `shekyl-relay-privacy/src/params.rs` | pins the C++ constant |
| covert linkage instruments | `shekyl-relay-privacy/src/conformance/linkage.rs` | Q-11 Unit 2's substrate |

**The Rust half already models the target architecture** and the C++ half does
not — which is §42.5b's finding: the decision layer is already Rust
(`shekyl_relay_zone_plan_relay_with_refresh`), and the covert branch is the one
path that never asks it.

### 1.4 The covert branch is not merely unused — it is WRONG (§42.5a)

Recorded here so nobody restores it as-is. The branch:

1. puts the **carrier check above the phase switch**, so a carrier is chosen
   *instead of* a phase rather than *for* one;
2. **downgrades a stem to `local`** with `MWARNING("Dandelion++ stem not
   supported over noise networks")` — Monero's posture that noise *replaces*
   Dandelion++, which §89 contradicts;
3. **broadcasts on every channel** rather than the bound stem slot,
   contradicting `CovertSchedule`.

**A naive reconnection would silently switch the anonymity zone from stemming to
not stemming**, reversing §89 and disarming the coherence branch the D9 arc
landed. That is why §1.1's change is the *last* step of the plan, not the first.

### 1.5 What keeps it exercised — the evidence a dead-code sweep would miss

**The machinery is not untested. It is unreachable in the production
*configuration* only.** Three gtests construct notifiers with an explicit
payload via `make_notifier(2048, …)`, bypassing the config path entirely:

- `levin_notify.noise`
- `levin_notify.noise_stem` — **annotated as a tripwire**; it pins §1.4's
  inherited behaviour and must go red when §42.3 lands
- `levin_notify.noise_repoint_discards_in_flight_remainder` — CV-1's only
  witness

Between them they drive `send_noise`, `clear_channel`, `queue_covert_notify`,
the FFI covert dispatch and the covert scheduler. Plus four covert tests on the
Rust side (`zone/tests.rs`, `relay_zone_ffi/tests.rs`), including
`a_covert_deadline_survives_wakes_it_did_not_cause` (CV-3).

**So: coverage exists, callers do not.** A sweep keyed on "no production
caller" deletes a mechanism with live tests and a ruled restoration plan.

### 1.6 The ONLY conditions under which deletion is correct

Not "no callers". Deletion requires **abandoning §42 as a design**, which means
re-opening, in writing:

- **§91.2** — Design A's ruling that Tor-only is a supported posture. Cover
  traffic is what defends the node↔proxy wire; without it the wire-observer row
  of §32.6 is undefended and "supported" weakens.
- **§42.4** — the carrier's narrowed job (deny the count of *originations*).
- **§32.6's grid** — the wire-observer recall cell, which cover is the only
  mechanism addressing.
- **Q-11 Unit 2** — `conformance/linkage.rs` is its substrate.

If a future round rules cover traffic out on its merits, deletion follows and
this document is its record. Until then, **no-production-caller is the design**
(the P-transport precedent: a designed seam is not unwired because it is not yet
called).
