# Daemon Relay Privacy — correcting and porting the Dandelion++ timing layer

**Status:** ROUND 1 applied. The measurement that motivates this document
landed alongside it in the same PR (`rust/shekyl-relay-privacy`, 81 tests), so
every number below is reproducible rather than asserted. Round 1 raised three
findings (RD-1…RD-3); **all three are accepted and dispositioned in §10**, and
their consequences are folded into the body rather than appended as errata.
RD-1 materially moved the adopted embargo (31 s → 112 s) and surfaced a fifth
defect (F-5). RD-2 resolved Q-2, which is now closed. Decisions D-1…D-7 stand
as amended; the remaining open questions in §7 are the Round-2 agenda.
**Process rule:** [`26-sub-pr-design-discipline.mdc`](../../.cursor/rules/26-sub-pr-design-discipline.mdc)
(FFI-boundary-moving), and
[`20-rust-vs-cpp-policy.mdc`](../../.cursor/rules/20-rust-vs-cpp-policy.mdc)
§"Migration is a planning activity" — this document exists so the port is not
folded into feature work.
**Spec-first per** [`05-system-thinking.mdc`](../../.cursor/rules/05-system-thinking.mdc).
**Timeframes (rule 05):** *now* — the relay layer is the only privacy
mechanism protecting transaction origin at the network layer, and three of its
four randomized quantities are mis-specified; *mining-era end* — nothing here
carries reward-era assumptions, the parameters are network-topology-driven;
*V4 lattice-only* — relay timing is cryptography-agnostic and survives any
membership-proof successor untouched.

**Not consensus.** Every quantity in this document is node-local relay policy.
Nodes running different delays do not fork, no rule reads these values, and
none of this is genesis-blocking. It is being fixed before ship because it is
*wrong*, not because a deadline forces it.

## 0. Problem statement (verified at source and by measurement)

Shekyl inherits a complete Dandelion++ implementation from the Monero
lineage: the stem map in [`src/net/dandelionpp.cpp`](../../src/net/dandelionpp.cpp),
the epoch/stem/fluff orchestration in
[`src/cryptonote_protocol/levin_notify.cpp`](../../src/cryptonote_protocol/levin_notify.cpp),
and the stem embargo in
[`src/cryptonote_core/tx_pool.cpp`](../../src/cryptonote_core/tx_pool.cpp).
The routing is sound. The *timing* — which is the entire privacy mechanism —
is not, and was never tested.

**The test surface is empty.** `tests/unit_tests/levin.cpp` has 33
`levin_notify` cases. Every one drives the relay path through `run_epoch()`,
`run_stems()` or `run_fluff()`, each of which **cancels the pending timer** to
force immediate execution. The suite verifies who receives what with which
fluff flag. Not one case observes a delay. There is no test, anywhere in the
tree, of any randomized quantity in the relay layer.

Four defects, each verified against source and measured:

| # | Defect | Site | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **F-1** | The embargo constant does not follow from its own stated derivation | [`tx_pool.cpp:66-87`](../../src/cryptonote_core/tx_pool.cpp#L66-L87) | Medium — wrong value |
| **F-2** | The embargo is drawn from a Poisson; its derivation assumes an exponential. At these means the timer is near-deterministic and effectively never fires | [`tx_pool.cpp:1031`](../../src/cryptonote_core/tx_pool.cpp#L1031), [`duration.h`](../../src/crypto/duration.h) | **High — mechanism absent** |
| **F-3** | The closed form substitutes `E[K]` into an expression in `K(K-1)`; stem length is geometric, so it under-provisions at every fluff probability | [`tx_pool.cpp:66-87`](../../src/cryptonote_core/tx_pool.cpp#L66-L87) | Medium — no constant correction fixes it |
| **F-4** | The **fluff delay** has the same distribution defect as F-2, on the timer every node applies to every transaction | [`levin_notify.cpp:75-90`](../../src/cryptonote_protocol/levin_notify.cpp#L75-L90), [`:439-440`](../../src/cryptonote_protocol/levin_notify.cpp#L439-L440) | **High — mechanism degraded** |
| **F-5** | Because of F-4, the fluff flood itself is ~7× slower than it needs to be — first passage to an arbitrary node takes ~13.75 s (p90) instead of ~2.25 s. A throughput consequence of the same defect, and it feeds back into the embargo derivation | same as F-4 | **High — network-wide latency** |

Two further observations that are not defects but are undocumented choices
the design round must make deliberately (§7): timer **granularity** (O-1) and
the **hop-latency** input the whole derivation rests on (O-2).

**Round 1 correction to the model itself.** The survival equation as first
written ended a stem node's exposure when the terminal node *emitted* the
fluff. The mechanism ends it when that fluff *reaches* the node. See
[RD-1](#101-rd-1-the-survival-equation-ended-exposure-at-the-wrong-event) — it
is the largest single correction in this document and it changed the adopted
embargo by a factor of 3.6.

### F-1 — the constant contradicts its own comment

`tx_pool.cpp:66-87` states the derivation inputs and the answer:

> This value was calculated with k=5, ep=0.10, and hop = 175 ms. […] So 175ms
> is the fudge factor for a single hop with 39s being the embargo timer.

Under the Dandelion++ appendix B.5 formula
`Tbase = (-k·(k-1)·hop) / (2·ln(1-ep))`, those inputs give **16.61 s**, not 39.
The 39 s figure is reproduced by substituting a **base-10 logarithm** for the
natural logarithm the formula specifies: that gives 38.245 s, and exactly 39 at
`hop = 178 ms`. The counter-check is executable —
`params::reconciles_under_log10`, asserted in
`params::tests::log10_substitution_reproduces_the_inherited_constant`.

### F-2 — the distribution family is wrong, and it disables the mechanism

The `ln(1-ep)` term is the signature of an **exponential survival function**.
The derivation models each node arming a memoryless timer and asks how likely
it is that none fires early. The daemon draws from
`crypto::random_poisson_seconds` — `std::poisson_distribution`, a discrete
*count*, whose standard deviation is `√λ`. At λ = 39 the coefficient of
variation is 0.16; the timer is very nearly a constant.

Measured (`tests/propagation_measurement.rs`, 200k trials, q=20%, hop=175 ms):

```text
parameter set                 embargo      hops     mean fluff      p99 fluff   full-travel    preempted
shipped: 39s Poisson              39s      3.99          699ms         3500ms        1.0000       0.0000
constant fixed: 17s Poisson       17s      3.99          699ms         3500ms        1.0000       0.0000
as derived: 17s memoryless        17s      3.99          699ms         3500ms        0.8474       0.1526
```

Both Poisson rows sit at full-travel 1.0000 — **the black-hole backstop never
fires**, against a stem that completes in 699 ms mean / 3.5 s p99. The embargo
is a formality, not a mechanism.

Note the second row: **correcting F-1 alone changes nothing measurable.** A
Poisson at 17 s has exactly the defect a Poisson at 39 s has. Fixing the
constant without fixing the distribution would have been wasted work that
looked like a fix.

There is a second consequence beyond the missing backstop. A low-variance
timer means that *when* the embargo does fire, it fires at a predictable
offset from broadcast — so an embargo-released fluff is distinguishable from a
natural one and timestamps the original broadcast. A memoryless timer does not
carry that signal.

### F-3 — the closed form under-provisions, and no constant factor fixes it

The formula substitutes the *expected* stem length `k` into an expression in
`k(k-1)`. Stem length is not fixed; it is geometric. For geometric `K`,

```text
E[K(K-1)] = 2 · E[K] · (E[K] - 1)     exactly, at every fluff probability
```

so the closed form is solving for the wrong quantity by a factor of two —
*before* Jensen's inequality is reached, since the quantity actually wanted is
`E[exp(-c·K(K-1))]` and not `exp(-c·E[K(K-1)])`. Neither substitution is the
answer, and no constant correction factor recovers it.

`derive::tests::the_closed_form_under_provisions_at_every_fluff_probability`
pins this across `q ∈ 1..=50%`.

### F-4 — the same defect on the timer that runs on every transaction

`levin_notify.cpp:84-88` names its reference:

> Bitcoin Core is using 1/2 average seconds for outgoing connections compared
> to incoming.

Bitcoin Core's send timer, `PoissonNextSend`, computes `-ln(U)·mean` — the
**inter-arrival time of a Poisson process**, which is an *exponential*. The
inherited code implements `std::poisson_distribution`, which is the discrete
*count* of a Poisson process. The names coincide; the distributions do not.

This matters more than F-2. The embargo is a rare backstop; the fluff delay is
applied by every node to every transaction, and its entire purpose is to stop
an observer inferring *when a node received a transaction* from *when it
relayed it*.

Measured (`fluff_delay_inference_resistance`) — probability that an adversary
subtracting a fixed optimal offset pins receipt time to within a tolerance:

```text
delay draw                              CV       ±0.25s        ±0.5s          ±1s
inherited: Poisson lambda=20         0.224       0.2623       0.4236       0.6867
memoryless: geometric mean=20        1.025       0.1362       0.2165       0.3554
```

Same 5 s mean; the inherited draw is ~1.96× more invertible at every tolerance
an adversary might pick. A delay with CV 0.22 is not providing randomized
delay — it is providing a constant with a rounding error.

## 1. Decision record (as amended by Round 1)

| # | Decision | Rests on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-1** | The embargo is drawn from a **discrete memoryless (geometric)** distribution, not a Poisson | F-2 |
| **D-2** | The embargo mean is **solved exactly** from the survival equation, never hard-coded and never taken from the closed form | F-1, F-3 |
| **D-3** | The fluff delay is drawn from the **same memoryless family**, at the inherited means | F-4 |
| **D-4** | Timer granularity is an **explicit input** to the derivation, defaulting to 250 ms | O-1 |
| **D-5** | Hop latency is an **explicit, conservatively-set input** with a testnet-measurement reopening trigger | O-2 |
| **D-6** | Fluff probability `q` stays at **20%**; it is not demonstrably wrong and re-tuning it is out of scope | §7 Q-3 |
| **D-7** | The Rust core owns *when* and *to whom*; C++ keeps *how to serialize and send*. **No async runtime.** | §4 |

### D-1 — memoryless embargo

The geometric distribution is the exact discrete analogue of the exponential
and the only memoryless discrete distribution. The inherited timer already
works in integer time units, so discretizing costs nothing. Implemented in
`geometric.rs` as a frozen integer inverse-CDF, the same construction the
Poisson table uses.

*Reversion clause — **withdrawn in Round 1** (RD-2).* The clause named a
shifted geometric (a floor plus a memoryless tail) as the replacement, on a
measurement of "mode-at-zero harm". RD-2 established that no such measurement
can exist: a constant floor is a pure shift, and every inversion metric is a
maximum over sliding windows and therefore shift-invariant by construction, so
the alternative could never beat the incumbent on any instrument in the tree.
That is an armed gate with no trigger.

Measuring it properly *settled* the question rather than merely unblocking it,
so the clause is **deleted rather than weakened**. A floor is dominated in both
framings a latency budget allows: as a pure shift it scores identically
(0.2165) and costs 8 ticks of latency for nothing; held to the same mean it
scores measurably **worse** (0.3298 vs 0.2165), because it buys its offset by
narrowing the random part. See §10.2 and
`residual_inversion_decides_the_distribution_shape`.

The surviving reversion condition for D-1 is narrower and honest: revert only
if the memoryless family is shown to break an invariant the *batching* design
depends on — not on inversion grounds, where it has now been tested and holds.

### D-2 — exact derivation, not a constant

`derive.rs` solves the true survival equation:

```text
P(full travel) = Σ_h  (1-q)^h · q · (1-p)^S(h),   S(h) = Σ_{j=0}^{h} ceil(j·hop/τ)
```

by bisection on the mean, which is monotone. Every term is a product of powers
of `(1-q)` and `(1-p)`, computed by running multiplication — **no `exp`, no
`ln`, no `pow`** — so the derivation is bit-identical on every platform.

**Round 1 amended the equation** (RD-1): each stem node's required exposure is
`(j·hop + F)/τ`, not `j·hop/τ`, where `F` is the fluff flood's return time. The
`j = 0` term stays zero — the terminal node disarms its own embargo at the
moment it fluffs. The correction preserves the running-product structure
exactly, so the derivation is still transcendental-free.

At the inherited inputs with the measured return term it yields **112 s**
(446 ticks at 250 ms), achieving 0.9000. The independent Monte-Carlo simulator
— corrected in the same way — solves it at 115 s, within 2.7%, and their
survival curves agree to ≤0.0010 across both the mean *and* the tick
(`analytic_derivation_agrees_with_the_simulator`).

| source | value |
| --- | --- |
| closed form (paper, plug-in `k`) | 17 s |
| exact derivation, RD-1 uncorrected | 31 s |
| **exact derivation, RD-1 corrected (adopted)** | **112 s** |
| simulator cross-check | 115 s |
| inherited `#define` | 39 s |

The 31 s figure was a lower bound, and a loose one: at the measured return term
it delivers 0.7292, not 0.9002.

The inherited 39 s lands near the right answer *by way of a logarithm-base
error rather than this correction*, and is paired with a distribution under
which the timer barely fires. Two wrongs approximately cancelling is not a
derivation, and the near-miss is why this was never caught by inspection.

### D-3 — memoryless fluff delay

Same family as D-1, at the inherited means (λ = 20 quarter-seconds inbound,
10 outbound). The **quarter-second granularity is retained** — its comment at
`levin_notify.cpp:75-80` is the one derivation in this subsystem that survives
checking, and the reasoning (whole seconds too coarse, milliseconds too tight)
is correct.

The outbound/inbound 1:2 ratio is also retained. It is Bitcoin Core's, the
reasoning is sound (a node controls who it connects *to*), and nothing in the
measurement contradicts it.

**Why memoryless specifically — the argument Round 1 required be stated
(RD-2).** It is *not* "geometric inverts worst." It does not: a uniform delay
over `[0, 2μ]` scores better at phase 0 (0.1220 vs 0.2165). Stating the
decision on raw inversion precision alone would leave it open to exactly that
refutation.

The real argument is structural, and it comes from the code path.
`levin_notify.cpp`'s `fluff_notify` draws a flush deadline **only when a peer's
batch is empty**; a transaction arriving mid-window joins the pending batch and
goes out at the already-drawn deadline. What such a transaction experiences is
therefore the **residual** of a draw that has already survived some phase — not
a fresh draw. Only the memoryless family makes the residual distribution
identical to the full one, which is what makes a single headline inversion
number describe *every* transaction rather than only one that happened to
arrive at window start.

Measured (`residual_inversion_decides_the_distribution_shape`), inversion
precision at ±0.5 s against arrival phase in ticks:

| delay draw | phase 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| memoryless geometric (mean 20) | 0.2165 | 0.2165 | 0.2165 | 0.2165 |
| inherited Poisson (λ 20) | 0.4236 | 0.4257 | 0.7041 | **0.9318** |
| uniform `U[0,40]` (mean 20) | **0.1220** | 0.1613 | 0.2381 | 0.4545 |

Uniform's advantage is real at phase 0 and gone by phase 20. Only the
memoryless row is flat. This also sharpens F-4: the inherited Poisson is
**near-perfectly invertible for a transaction arriving late in a window**
(0.9318), which is worse than its phase-0 figure suggested.

### D-4 — granularity is a parameter

The inherited embargo ticks in **whole seconds**, against a stem that
completes in ~700 ms. At that granularity "fires within the first tick"
collapses to "fires at zero", and a measurable share of preemption is rounding
rather than mechanism. Measured convergence (`embargo_tick_granularity_matters`):

```text
tick = 1000ms   full-travel 0.7869
tick =  500ms   full-travel 0.8212
tick =  250ms   full-travel 0.8461
tick =  125ms   full-travel 0.8551
tick =   50ms   full-travel 0.8639
```

250 ms is adopted: it matches the quarter-second precedent already in this
subsystem, and the derivation absorbs the tick, so the choice is about
fidelity rather than correctness — any tick hits the target once solved at
that tick.

### D-5 — hop latency

The entire embargo derivation rests on one input that exists **only inside a
code comment**: `hop = 175 ms`, justified as "a testrun from a recent Intel
laptop took ~80ms […] At least 50ms will be added to the latency if crossing
an ocean." That is a 2019 observation about someone else's network.

The error is asymmetric, and that decides the default. Over-estimating hop
gives a longer embargo: fires less often, slower black-hole recovery.
Under-estimating gives premature fluffing — transactions cut short of their
stem, which is a **privacy loss**. Measured sensitivity
(`embargo_sensitivity_to_hop_latency_assumption`, embargo derived at 175 ms):

```text
actual hop = 175ms   preempted 0.0000
actual hop = 350ms   preempted 0.0009
actual hop = 500ms   preempted 0.0048
actual hop = 1000ms  preempted 0.0428
```

Since the privacy-losing direction is under-estimation, the pre-network
default over-estimates. **Proposed: 350 ms** (2× the inherited assumption).

*Reopening trigger:* the first testnet with representative geography measures
real inter-node relay latency; this input is re-set from that measurement and
the embargo re-derived. Until then 350 ms is a documented placeholder, not a
result.

**Round 1 adds a sibling input (RD-1): the fluff-flood return time `F`.** It
has the same status as hop latency — a topology input, conservatively set from
a high quantile, with the same testnet reopening trigger — and after the RD-1
correction it *dominates* the hop term, so the testnet measurement must capture
fluff-return first passage and not only stem hop latency. It is currently
**2250 ms**, the measured p90 for a memoryless flood at 8 peers
(`simulate_fluff_return`). Sensitivity, at the 0.90 target:

| `F` | derived embargo |
| --- | --- |
| 0 ms (RD-1 uncorrected) | 31 s |
| 500 ms | 49 s |
| 1500 ms | 85 s |
| **2250 ms (adopted)** | **112 s** |
| 4250 ms | 183 s |
| 13750 ms (inherited Poisson flood) | 521 s |

### D-6 — fluff probability stays at 20%

`q = 20%` sits at the permissive end of the paper's own `q ≤ 0.2`
recommendation. It is not demonstrably wrong, and unlike F-1…F-4 there is no
defect to fix. Lowering it lengthens stems (larger anonymity set, higher
broadcast latency, longer embargo — `Tbase` scales with `k(k-1)`); the
trade-off curve is measured in `fluff_probability_trade_curve` and is
available to a later round.

Changing it is a **separate question** from fixing what is incorrect, and
folding it in would make this document's scope unreviewable. *Reopening
trigger:* a threat-model round that quantifies the anonymity-set benefit
against the latency cost for Shekyl's expected topology.

### D-7 — the port seam

Rust decides *when* and *to whom*. C++ keeps *how to serialize and send*:
epee binary serialization, the 1024-byte padding walk, levin framing,
fragmentation and compression. This workspace has no epee or levin
implementation and building one is a separate multi-thousand-line project
(§8).

**No async runtime.** Every type in `schedule.rs` is a plain `&mut self` state
machine returning a deadline in monotonic milliseconds. The daemon's relay
path runs inside a `boost::asio` strand; the Rust core is called from inside
that strand and returns "next deadline", which the existing `steady_timer`
arms. A core that demanded its own reactor would mean reconciling two event
loops for no gain.

## 2. What lands where

**RP-1 (landed, this PR).** `rust/shekyl-relay-privacy` — the measurement
instrument and the corrected primitives. Links nothing, replaces nothing,
changes no daemon behaviour.

| module | contents |
| --- | --- |
| `params.rs` | Design inputs; every derived quantity is a method, never a stored field, so a parameter set cannot hold an embargo that disagrees with its own fluff probability |
| `derive.rs` | The exact survival equation and the bisection solve (D-2) |
| `poisson.rs` | Frozen integer inverse-CDF replacing `std::poisson_distribution` |
| `geometric.rs` | The memoryless draw (D-1, D-3) |
| `rng.rs` | `RelayRng` seam; unbiased rejection sampler |
| `stem_map.rs` | Port of `connection_map`, `nil_uuid` sentinel replaced by `Option` in its three distinct roles |
| `schedule.rs` | Epoch / fluff / embargo / noise state machines (D-7) |
| `conformance.rs` | Feature-gated grades, the propagation simulator, the inversion instrument |

**RP-2…RP-4 (not yet scoped — gated on this document converging).** Sketch
only; the sequence is decided in review, not here:

- **RP-2** — FFI + cut `connection_map` over; delete `src/net/dandelionpp.cpp`.
  The `dandelionpp_map` block in `tests/unit_tests/net.cpp` (≈1787–2140) is the
  acceptance gate.
- **RP-3** — cut the epoch/fluff scheduler; `levin_notify.cpp` becomes a
  transport shim. The 33 existing `levin_notify` gtests must pass **unchanged**
  — they exercise the public `notify` API, so they are a free regression oracle
  for the riskiest step.
- **RP-4** — the `tx_pool.cpp` embargo.

---

## 3. Why the distributions are re-implemented rather than bound

`std::poisson_distribution` and `std::uniform_int_distribution` are
**implementation-defined**: the standard fixes the distribution, not the
algorithm. Three consequences shaped RP-1:

1. **No cross-language differential oracle is possible.** libstdc++ and libc++
   emit different sequences from identical entropy, so a port cannot be
   validated by differential replay the way the C++-as-oracle consensus port
   is. That pattern does not transfer here; only a statistical grade is
   available.
2. Two Shekyl nodes built against different standard libraries **already** draw
   different sequences today. Harmless for node-local timing, but it means
   "the C++ behaviour" is not a single well-defined thing to reproduce.
3. The distribution is not a reviewable artifact anywhere in the C++ tree — it
   is whatever the toolchain shipped.

RP-1 makes it one. Both tables are built by recurrences using only `+`, `*`
and `/` — no transcendentals — so they are bit-identical on every platform,
and every draw after construction is integer. The table *is* the distribution:
printable, diffable, and pinned by fingerprint in `tests/golden_vector.rs`.

---

## 4. The FFI surface (RP-2+, sketch)

Everything `levin_notify` reaches outward for is six calls:

```text
p2p.foreach_connection(cb)        → snapshot of (uuid, is_income, remote_height)
p2p.send(blob, uuid)              → bool
p2p.get_out_connections_count()
core->get_current_blockchain_height()
core->is_synchronized()
core->on_transactions_relayed(txs, relay_method)
```

Boost UUIDs are 16 bytes → `ConnectionId([u8; 16])`, a memcpy. For scale
comparison, the existing daemon-submit boundary is 754 lines of C++ shim plus
459 Rust; this one is smaller.

---

## 5. Test obligations

| Gate | Where | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Every distribution graded against its claim | `tests/conformance_grading.rs` | RP-1 ✅ |
| Every grade paired with a **negative control that must fail** | same | RP-1 ✅ |
| Analytic derivation cross-checked against an independent simulator | `analytic_derivation_agrees_with_the_simulator` | RP-1 ✅ |
| Each finding pinned as an executable assertion | `params.rs`, `derive.rs`, `tests/propagation_measurement.rs` | RP-1 ✅ |
| Frozen reference vectors, cross-architecture | `tests/golden_vector.rs` | RP-1 ✅ |
| 33 `levin_notify` gtests pass unchanged after the cut | `tests/unit_tests/levin.cpp` | RP-3 |
| `dandelionpp_map` gtests pass against the Rust map | `tests/unit_tests/net.cpp` | RP-2 |

The negative controls are not optional. A conformance test that only ever sees
correct input passes whether or not it can detect anything; each grade in RP-1
is run twice, once against the real draw and once against a deliberately
corrupted one that **must** fail.

---

## 6. Threat model note

The mechanism being repaired protects **transaction-origin attribution at the
network layer** against an observer who sees relay timing — a peer, a set of
sybil peers, or a passive network observer. It is independent of, and
complementary to, the FCMP++ membership privacy that protects on-chain
linkage: a transaction can be perfectly unlinkable on-chain and still have its
origin node identified by timing.

Per [`00-mission`](../../.cursor/rules/00-mission.mdc), the binding commitment
is **privacy is the product** — the same guarantees for everyone, never a
setting. F-2 and F-4 are failures of that commitment: the mechanism is
advertised (by its own comments) and structurally present, but measurably not
functioning. That is why this is being fixed before ship despite not being
consensus and not being genesis-blocking.

The [`FOLLOWUPS.md`](../FOLLOWUPS.md) §5289 acceptance criteria for claim
broadcast — "a Dandelion++-equivalent stem/fluff phase under the anonymity
network" — depend on this layer being correct. That entry should be re-read
once this document converges; it currently assumes the inherited implementation
is a working baseline to build on.

---

## 7. Open questions (the Round-2 agenda)

Round 1 closed Q-2 and Q-7 and reframed Q-5. What remains:

- **Q-1 — is the stem model right?** *(Round 1 position: single-path is
  correct.)* Each node forwards to one per-source successor, so branching
  shapes the anonymity set, not survival. The case still worth checking is path
  self-intersection: a revisited node re-uses an already-armed timer, which
  strictly *helps* survival, so the equation is conservative there. Likely
  constant-level and dwarfed by RD-1. **Carried, low priority.**
- **Q-3 — is `q = 20%` right for Shekyl?** D-6 defers deliberately; the trade
  curve is measured and on file. Round 1 notes that RD-1's correction lengthens
  the required embargo, which *strengthens* the case for not simultaneously
  lengthening stems. **Carried.**
- **Q-4 — is 250 ms the right tick?** The derivation absorbs it, so this is
  fidelity and table size, not correctness. Round 1 position: fine as is.
  **Effectively closed; reopen only on a table-size or timer-resolution
  constraint.**
- **Q-5 — what are Shekyl's real hop latency *and fluff-return* times?**
  Reframed by RD-1: after the correction the return term dominates the hop
  term, so a testnet that measures only hop latency measures the wrong thing.
  D-5's 350 ms and D-5's 2250 ms are both placeholders with named triggers.
  **Open, and now the highest-value measurement.**
- **Q-6 — noise channels (I2P/Tor).** *(Round 1 position: out of scope.)*
  `NoiseCadence` is constant-rate cover traffic — a different mechanism with a
  different analysis, and its bounded `10 s + U[0, 5 s]` cadence must not be
  memoryless-ified as a side effect of this port. RP-1 models the draw so it is
  not invisible; the analysis gets its own document when the port reaches it.
  **Closed here, deferred to its own doc.**
- **Q-8 (new, from RD-1) — is 0.90-on-*any*-preemption the right target?**
  This is now the binding assumption. A 112 s embargo is a real liveness cost:
  a black-holed transaction sits undiffused for ~112 s. But the equation weights
  all preemptions equally, and a preemption by the *last* stem node leaks far
  less than one by the first — the tail of the stem is the part an adversary
  learns least from. A position-weighted target would likely permit a much
  shorter embargo at the same privacy. **This is the question most likely to
  change the adopted number, and it needs a stated leakage model before it can
  be answered.**

**Closed in Round 1:**

- **Q-2 — memoryless mode-at-zero.** Closed by RD-2. A constant floor is
  dominated in both framings a latency budget allows; D-1's reversion clause is
  withdrawn. See §10.2.
- **Q-7 — does the fluff-delay fix interact with the embargo derivation?**
  Closed by RD-1 — and the answer was much bigger than the question. It is not
  that the effective hop time might include the fluff delay; it is that every
  stem node's exposure window gains a diffusion-return term. See §10.1.

## 8. Cuprate — recorded so the question is not reopened by accident

`Cuprate` publishes `cuprate-dandelion-tower`, whose `config.rs` independently
reaches D-2's conclusion (derive `Tbase`, do not hard-code it). It is prior
art, credited as such, and worth reading. It is **not** a dependency:

1. **It is not published.** Every Cuprate crate on crates.io —
   `cuprate-levin`, `cuprate-epee-encoding`, `cuprate-wire`,
   `cuprate-dandelion-tower` — exists only as a `0.0.0-placeholder` name
   reservation (verified via the sparse index, 2026-07-23). The real code is
   monorepo-internal with workspace-relative dependencies, so consuming it
   means vendoring at a pinned commit, not `cargo add` — a
   [`17-dependency-discipline`](../../.cursor/rules/17-dependency-discipline.mdc)
   posture change, and a [`10-shekyl-first`](../../.cursor/rules/10-shekyl-first.mdc)
   question about adopting a sibling's application code.
2. **The shape is wrong for this seam.** `dandelion-tower` is a
   `tower::Service` stack over tokio timers and futures streams, and abstracts
   the tx-pool behind traits we would implement against LMDB. D-7 exists
   precisely to keep a second reactor out of the p2p path.

Its `net/levin` and `net/epee-encoding` are a **genuinely different question**.
They would remove the single largest obstacle to ever moving the *full* relay
path into Rust — that this workspace has no epee or levin implementation. Both
are MIT with light dependency lists. That belongs to its own decision, not to
this document, and it is not on the path for RP-2…RP-4.

## 9. Reversion clauses (rule 21)

- **D-1**'s original reversion clause is **withdrawn** (RD-2): it was
  untriggerable, and measuring it properly closed the question against the
  named alternative rather than merely unblocking it. What survives is narrow —
  revert only if memorylessness breaks a *batching* invariant, not on inversion
  grounds, where it has now been tested and holds.
- **D-2** has no reversion: an exact solve of the stated equation is not a
  preference. If the *equation* is wrong, the equation is corrected and the
  solve re-run — the mechanism of deriving-rather-than-hardcoding stands. Round
  1 exercised this clause exactly as written: RD-1 showed the equation was
  wrong, the equation was corrected, the solve was re-run, and the adopted
  value moved 31 s → 112 s without D-2 itself being reopened. A hard-coded
  constant would have needed a decision to change; a derivation needed only a
  corrected input.
- **D-5**'s 350 ms hop and 2250 ms fluff-return are both explicitly
  provisional and revert on the first real measurement. After RD-1 the return
  term dominates, so the measurement that matters most is the one nobody had
  thought to ask for.
- **D-6** reopens on a threat-model round, not on preference.

## 10. Round 1 dispositions

All three findings accepted. RD-1 and RD-2 are folded into §0/§1 above; this
section records what was checked and what changed, so a later reader can see
the reasoning without reconstructing it.

### 10.1 RD-1 — the survival equation ended exposure at the wrong event

**Accepted, and larger than sketched.**

*Verified at source.* `tx_pool.cpp`'s `set_relayed` calls
`meta.upgrade_relay_method(method)` and only then tests `meta.dandelionpp_stem`;
if the method has upgraded out of stem, `last_relayed_time` is set to `now`
with no embargo term. The receive path in `add_tx` carries the same upgrade,
under a comment that names it outright: *"synchronize with embargo timer or
stem/fluff out-of-order messages"*. So a stem node's embargo is disarmed when
**it observes the fluff**, not when the terminal node emits it. True exposure is
`(h-i)·hop + F_i`, and the flood's every edge carries a fluff delay.

*Measured.* `simulate_fluff_return` models the flood as first passage on a
random graph with per-edge fluff delays — which is what the daemon does, since
a node draws one flush deadline per peer connection. At 512 nodes, 8 peers:

| fluff delay on each edge | mean | p90 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inherited: Poisson λ=20 | 11.2 s | 13.75 s |
| memoryless: geometric mean 20 | 1.5 s | 2.25 s |

This is **F-5**, and it confirms the mitigating structure Round 1 predicted:
first passage is a minimum over parallel paths, and a minimum only helps when
the paths differ. Under the inherited near-deterministic delay every path costs
about the same and the flood crawls; under a memoryless delay it is ~7× faster.
**Fixing F-4 substantially repairs the gap that counting `F` opens** — without
it the required embargo would be 521 s rather than 112 s.

*Consequence.* Equation amended (D-2), simulator amended identically so the
cross-check still compares like with like, adopted embargo 31 s → **112 s**,
and the previously-derived 31 s reassessed at **0.7292** — inside the 0.61–0.85
band Round 1 sketched. Q-7 is subsumed and closed.

*What it opens.* A 112 s embargo is a substantial liveness cost, which promotes
Round 1's second mitigating structure from a footnote to the **leading open
question (Q-8)**: the equation weights all preemptions equally, but a
preemption by the last stem node leaks far less than one by the first. That,
not the derivation, is now the assumption most likely to move the number.

### 10.2 RD-2 — the reversion clause was untriggerable

**Accepted; the clause is deleted rather than weakened.**

*Verified.* `inference_precision` is a maximum over sliding windows of the mass
and is therefore **shift-invariant by construction** — not merely empirically.
Any "add a floor" variant scores identically to its unshifted twin. The clause
armed a gate that no instrument in the tree could ever fire.

*Resolved rather than deferred.* Building the non-shift-invariant instrument
Round 1 asked for settled the question instead of just unblocking it. The
instrument is arrival-phase conditioning (`residual_masses`), motivated by the
re-armed batching flush, and under it a floor is dominated in **both** framings
a latency budget allows:

| variant | mean | inversion at ±0.5 s |
| --- | --- | --- |
| plain geometric | 20 ticks | 0.2165 |
| floor 8 + geo 20 — *pure shift* | 28 ticks | 0.2165 (identical, +8 ticks latency for nothing) |
| floor 8 + geo 12 — *same mean budget* | 20 ticks | **0.3298 (worse)** |

A floor buys its offset by narrowing the random part. So Q-2 is **closed
against the floor**, and D-1's reversion clause is withdrawn.

*Also adopted:* Round 1's point that D-3's stated justification was vulnerable
to its own adversarial reading. Uniform genuinely beats geometric at phase 0
(0.1220 vs 0.2165); the argument that survives is the residual/memorylessness
one, and D-3 now states it explicitly with the phase table behind it.

### 10.3 RD-3 — measurement labelling

**Accepted, both halves.**

*The F-2 table conflated two fixes.* The memoryless row ran at 250 ms while the
Poisson rows ran at the inherited whole second, so it moved distribution and
granularity together. The table now labels the tick per row and carries a
tick-held memoryless row, which separates them cleanly: the distribution fix
alone moves full-travel 0.9997 → 0.6002, and the finer tick adds a further
0.0177. D-1 does essentially all the work; D-4 is a fidelity refinement.

*The precision question resolves as noise, but the gate was real.* At 6M trials
the analytic and the simulator agree within ±1σ at **every** tick from 1000 ms
down to 50 ms (max |Δ| = 0.00016). The apparent ~3–4σ gap came from computing σ
against 200k trials, but that granularity test runs at `TRIALS/4` = 50k, where
σ ≈ 1.55e-3 and the gap is ~1.9σ. The underlying criticism stands regardless:
the cross-check only asserted at 250 ms, so a genuine tick-dependent divergence
would have had nothing watching it. It now sweeps the tick as well as the mean.
