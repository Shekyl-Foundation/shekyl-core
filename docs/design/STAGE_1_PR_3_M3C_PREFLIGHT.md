# Stage 1 PR 3 — M3c pre-flight investigation

**Status.** Read-only investigation. No code changes proposed yet.
This document re-anchors M3c against its actual structural state on
`dev` post-M3b/PR-#34, and disposes the divergence between the
[`STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
§3.3 written wording and what is implementable today.

**Branch.** `feat/stage-1-pr3-m3c` off `dev` at `ea1df2539` (post
M3b merge; post PR #35 baseline-zero / capture-guard merge; post
PR #36 runner-bisect workflow merge). Pre-flight commits land here
before implementation begins.

**Cross-references.**

- **Migration plan.**
  [`STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
  §3.3 (M3c — additive test caller) is the binding scope statement.
  This pre-flight refines its “byte-identical `SignedProofs`”
  language against the actual `tx_builder::sign_transaction` shape
  (which uses `OsRng` internally — strict byte-identity is not a
  reachable property at that surface).
- **Audit.**
  [`STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md)
  §3.1 (Implication for M3c): "M3c is **additive, not migrational**.
  Non-wallet2-bridged orchestrator callers of
  `tx_builder::sign_transaction`: zero." This pre-flight respects
  the audit framing — M3c introduces a new caller (a test caller),
  it does not migrate an existing one.
- **M3a divergence note.**
  [`STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
  §3.1 Divergence 3 documents the named-gap status of
  `KeyEngine::sign_transaction`: it returns
  `KeyEngineError::SignTransactionTraitSurfaceIncomplete` because
  `TxToSign`’s `outputs: Vec<TxOutputContext>` and
  `fcmp_plus_plus_context: FcmpPlusPlusContext` are PR-5-pinned
  forward-declared `pub(crate) struct {}` stubs. M3c cannot exercise
  the trait method end-to-end at this point in the migration.
- **M3b precedent.**
  [`STAGE_1_PR_3_M3B_PREFLIGHT.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_M3B_PREFLIGHT.md)
  §D5 is the test-placement precedent. M3b D5 (the bundle byte-
  identical test) was specified for
  `tests/byte_identical_derivation.rs` but landed as a unit test in
  `local_keys.rs::tests` because `KeyEngine` and
  `derive_source_secrets_bundle` are `pub(crate)` and integration
  tests run as external crates. M3c-via-C inherits the same
  visibility constraint and the same disposition.

---

## §1 What changed since the migration plan was written

The migration plan’s §3.3 wording predates two structural facts
that landed during M3a/M3b execution:

### §1.1 `KeyEngine::sign_transaction` is non-functional

Per
[`STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
§3.1 Divergence 3, the trait method’s implementor body
(`local_keys.rs:531–543`) returns
`KeyEngineError::SignTransactionTraitSurfaceIncomplete`
unconditionally. The named-gap signal exists by design — per
[`STAGE_1_PR_3_KEY_ENGINE.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_KEY_ENGINE.md) §3.3,
`TxToSign`’s shape is PR-5-pinned because the per-input
on-chain-public data and the FCMP++ tree-branch context belong to
the `PendingTxEngine` build path, not the key-derivation path.

**Implication.** A test that calls
`KeyEngine::sign_transaction(...)` end-to-end can only verify the
named-gap path; it cannot exercise the bridge to
`tx_builder::sign_transaction`. The bridge lands in PR 5.

### §1.2 `KeyEngine` is `pub(crate)`

Per the M3a Round 4a discipline lock recorded in
[`STAGE_1_PR_3_KEY_ENGINE.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_KEY_ENGINE.md) §4.4
(trait visibility evolution), `KeyEngine`, `LocalKeys`,
`SourceSecretsBundle`, and `KeyEngineError` are all `pub(crate)`
inside `shekyl-engine-core`. Visibility widens to `pub` only when
a downstream consumer needs the trait — currently scheduled for
the wallet-RPC-server cutover (post-RC1).

**Implication.** A test in `rust/shekyl-engine-core/tests/`
(integration tests, which run as external crates) cannot reach
`KeyEngine` or `SourceSecretsBundle`. M3c’s test caller must live
inside the crate as a unit test in `local_keys.rs::tests` (or a
peer test module under `engine/` with the same visibility), the
same disposition M3b D5 took.

### §1.3 `tx_builder::sign_transaction` is non-deterministic

Audit at `rust/shekyl-tx-builder/src/sign.rs:54–183`:

- Step 5 (pseudo-output blindings, lines 110–117) calls
  `Scalar::random(&mut OsRng)` for each of the first `n_in - 1`
  inputs.
- Step 2 (Bulletproof+ proof, line 80) calls
  `shekyl_bulletproofs::Bulletproof::prove_plus(&mut OsRng, …)`.
- Step 7 (FCMP++ proof, line 164) calls `proof::prove(…)`, which
  also draws from `OsRng` internally.

The function takes no RNG parameter. Two invocations with
byte-identical inputs produce different `SignedProofs.bulletproof_plus`,
different `SignedProofs.fcmp_proof`, and different
`SignedProofs.pseudo_outs` bytes.

**Implication.** The migration plan’s §3.3 success-criterion line
"*Test produces byte-identical `SignedProofs` to the legacy path*"
is unreachable at this surface. The property M3c can pin instead is
**deterministic-component byte-identity plus
verifier-acceptance**:

- `SignedProofs.commitments` (output Pedersen commitments) is
  deterministic in `(mask, amount)`, both of which derive from
  the bundle/output-info inputs. **Pinned byte-wise** against the
  legacy path.
- `SignedProofs.enc_amounts` is a deterministic copy from
  `OutputInfo.enc_amount`. **Pinned byte-wise** against the legacy
  path.
- `SignedProofs.bulletproof_plus`, `.fcmp_proof`, `.pseudo_outs`
  are randomized. **Verified to verify.**

This is a stronger property than the migration plan’s wording: the
deterministic components are pinned, and the randomized components
are pinned not against legacy bytes (which would be brittle and
mostly tautological) but against the verifier (which is the
property that actually matters — that the engine path produces
proofs the verifier accepts).

## §2 Disposition: Option C

Three options were considered during the prior audit conversation
(2026-05-09):

- **Option A — Defer M3c.** Treat the migration plan’s §3.3
  literal text as binding; mark M3c as un-implementable until PR 5
  finalizes `TxToSign` and the bridge to `tx_builder::sign_transaction`
  is functional. Rejected: the migration tail (M3d, M3e) depends
  on M3c as a precondition per
  [`STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
  §3.4 dependencies; deferring M3c blocks M3d/M3e behind PR 5.
- **Option B — Treat M3c as already satisfied by M3b D5.** M3b D5
  pins bundle byte-identicality between engine and legacy
  derivations. Rejected: M3b D5 stops at the bundle (the
  cryptographic-derivation surface). M3c is supposed to validate
  the integration end-to-end through `tx_builder::sign_transaction`
  — i.e., that the bundle’s components are correctly consumed by
  the signing pipeline. M3b D5 does not pin that integration.
- **Option C — Direct call to `tx_builder::sign_transaction` from
  engine-derived bundles** (this disposition). Pin the property
  M3c was designed to validate (engine bundle drives a successful
  signing pipeline) at the surface where it is reachable today
  (`tx_builder::sign_transaction`), bypassing the non-functional
  `KeyEngine::sign_transaction` trait method. The bridge through
  the trait surface lands in PR 5.

**Adopted disposition: Option C.**

### §2.1 What Option C delivers

The new test (working name:
`engine_derived_bundle_signs_through_tx_builder_end_to_end`) sits
inline in `rust/shekyl-engine-core/src/engine/local_keys.rs::tests`
as a peer to M3b D5. It:

1. Constructs a `LocalKeys` from `TEST_SEED` (the same fixture M3b
   D5 uses).
2. For each of *N* synthetic inputs (suggested *N* = 3 — single,
   pair, triple — to exercise the n_in-dependent pseudo-output
   blinding loop):
   - Synthesizes a `(view_secret, source_ciphertext)` pair via the
     same `construct_output` shape M3b D5 uses.
   - Calls `keys.derive_source_secrets_bundle(...)` to obtain
     `SourceSecretsBundle`.
3. Constructs `tx_builder::SpendInput` records using the
   engine-derived bundle’s scalars (`spend_key_x`, `spend_key_y`,
   `mask_z`, plus tree-branch context built from the synthesized
   ciphertext).
4. Constructs matching `OutputInfo` records (recipient
   commitments + encrypted amounts).
5. Calls `tx_builder::sign_transaction(...)` and asserts:
   - **(a)** Returns `Ok(SignedProofs)`.
   - **(b)** `commitments` and `enc_amounts` are byte-identical to
     a parallel call constructed from a hand-derived legacy bundle
     (using `scan_output_recover` + hand-composed `(ho + b + m_i)`
     — the same legacy chain M3b D5 uses).
   - **(c)** A verifier (`shekyl_fcmp::proof::verify` and
     `shekyl_bulletproofs::Bulletproof::verify_plus`) accepts the
     proofs.
6. The test asserts these properties for at least 3 distinct
   `(output_index, subaddress_index)` combinations to surface any
   parameter-coupling regression.

### §2.2 Why this is the right validation milestone

The migration plan’s framing of M3c was “the property test the
audit-bounded migration relies on” — i.e., M3c provides the
evidence that allows M3d to remove the legacy
`TransferDetails`-secret-bearing fields and the bridge’s legacy-
fallback path. Option C delivers exactly that evidence:

- The engine’s deterministic bundle derivation reaches a verifier-
  accepting signature when fed through `tx_builder::sign_transaction`.
- The deterministic components match the legacy path byte-wise.
- Since the bundle derivation is the migration’s only secret-flow
  reroute (per
  [`STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md)
  §1: "Production SpendInput construction outside FFI/`native-sign`:
  zero sites"), and M3b D5 + M3c-via-C together pin the full
  cryptographic-derivation chain end-to-end, the precondition for
  M3d’s removal is satisfied.

## §3 Test scope

### §3.1 In-scope

- **One test function** in `local_keys.rs::tests` — see §2.1.
- **Test fixtures** reused from M3b D5 (`TEST_SEED`,
  `TEST_TX_KEY_SECRET`, `construct_output`, `scan_output_recover`,
  `subaddress_derivation_scalar`). No new fixtures introduced.
- **`tx_builder` test helpers.** The existing `dummy_tree()` /
  `dummy_output()` helpers in `shekyl-tx-builder/src/tests.rs` are
  test-only (`#[cfg(test)]`); they are not reachable from
  `shekyl-engine-core` because they live behind a `#[cfg(test)]`
  gate inside a different crate. M3c-via-C must construct the
  `TreeContext` and `OutputInfo` shapes inline. Adapter helpers
  (~30 lines) for the inline constructions land in
  `local_keys.rs::tests` next to the new test function.
- **One verifier call.** The verifier dependency (`shekyl_fcmp` for
  FCMP++ proof verification, `shekyl_bulletproofs` for BP+
  verification) is already a workspace dependency through
  `shekyl-tx-builder`. M3c-via-C imports the verifiers directly in
  `#[cfg(test)] dev-dependencies` if they are not already in scope.

### §3.2 Out-of-scope

- **Calling `KeyEngine::sign_transaction`.** Lands in PR 5 when
  `TxToSign`’s shape is finalized.
- **Integration test in `tests/`.** Blocked by `pub(crate)` lock;
  re-located when `KeyEngine` widens per the FOLLOWUPS V3.0 trigger
  entry. M3b D5 carries the same deferred re-location; M3c-via-C
  will be re-located alongside it under one PR.
- **`sign_pqc_auths` integration.** PQC auth signing is Phase 2 of
  the signing pipeline (per `tx_builder/src/sign.rs:185–245`). It
  consumes `combined_ss` material that flows through the bridge
  shape PR 5 finalizes. Out-of-scope for M3c-via-C; lands when the
  bridge lands.
- **Full transaction assembly.** M3c-via-C exercises
  `sign_transaction`, not the transaction builder’s assembly path.
  Transaction-level integration is wallet-RPC-cutover scope.

---

## §4 Risk register

- **R1 — `tx_builder::tests` private fixtures.** `dummy_tree()`,
  `dummy_output()`, etc. are `#[cfg(test)]`-private to
  `shekyl-tx-builder`. M3c-via-C inlines equivalent constructors
  (~30 LOC). If a future change to `tx_builder` mutates the
  `TreeContext` / `OutputInfo` shape, M3c-via-C’s inline
  constructors require parallel updates. Mitigation: keep the
  inline constructors *minimal* (just enough to drive a 1-input,
  1-output, fee=0 sign call) and document the `tx_builder`
  source-of-truth in the test docstring.
- **R2 — Verifier flake.** BP+ and FCMP++ verification under fresh
  `OsRng` randomness has historically been deterministic-on-success
  (the proof either verifies or doesn’t — there is no statistical
  failure path). The risk is essentially zero, but pinning the
  test as
  *flaky-must-not-flake* is the discipline.
- **R3 — Performance.** `tx_builder::sign_transaction` end-to-end
  is ~20 ms (per
  `shekyl-tx-builder/benches/transfer_e2e.rs`). The test runs at
  ~3 distinct fixtures × ~1 sign call each = ~60 ms. Within the
  migration plan’s `<1 s` budget for M3c (§3.3 success criteria).
- **R4 — `pub(crate)` reach.** All required types
  (`SourceSecretsBundle`, `LocalKeys::derive_source_secrets_bundle`,
  `keys.keys.x25519_pk`, etc.) are reachable from inside
  `local_keys.rs::tests`. Confirmed by M3b D5’s reach into the same
  surface. No visibility widening needed.
- **R5 — Test-vector coverage.** §2.1 specifies 3 fixtures
  covering 1-input / 2-input / 3-input cases (the smallest
  meaningful sweep over `n_in - 1` pseudo-blinding generation).
  The migration plan’s §3.3 says "≥3 existing test vectors" — the
  3-fixture sweep meets the count. Subaddress-index variation
  (PRIMARY + non-PRIMARY) covers the `m_i` injection point that M3b
  D5 also varies.
- **R6 — Migration plan staleness.** §3.3 of the migration plan
  was written before the §1.1–§1.3 facts surfaced. The plan
  document is updated by this pre-flight (peer doc) plus a
  cross-reference paragraph appended to §3.3 in the same M3c PR’s
  doc commit, naming the OptionC disposition and pointing back
  here.

## §5 Phase decomposition

Following M3b’s precedent
([`STAGE_1_PR_3_M3B_PREFLIGHT.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_M3B_PREFLIGHT.md)
landing notes — 10 commits across pre-flight + implementation +
docs):

- **Phase 0 (this commit).** Pre-flight document; no code.
- **Phase 1 — implementation.**
  1. **Commit 1.** Inline test-fixture helpers (`make_tree_context`,
     `make_output_info` in `local_keys.rs::tests`). ~50 LOC.
  2. **Commit 2.** The M3c-via-C test
     `engine_derived_bundle_signs_through_tx_builder_end_to_end`.
     ~150 LOC.
  3. **Commit 3** *(if needed)*. Verifier-acceptance assertion
     extension (covers §2.1 step 5(c)). May be folded into commit
     2 if the verifier import is one-line.
- **Phase 2 — docs.**
  4. Append cross-reference paragraph to
     [`STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
     §3.3 naming the Option-C disposition and pointing here. ~10
     LOC.
  5. Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` under the `### Added` section with
     a one-line note. ~3 LOC.
  6. Close-or-amend the FOLLOWUPS entry covering M3b D5 re-location
     to also cover M3c-via-C re-location at the same trigger
     (`KeyEngine` widens to `pub`). ~5 LOC of trigger-text edit.

**Estimate.** ~210 net code lines + ~20 docs lines; ~5 commits;
1 review round.

## §6 Success criteria

Mapped from
[`STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_3_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
§3.3’s original criteria, refined per §1.3:

- [ ] **§3.3 (a) revised.** Test passes against ≥3 synthetic
      tx_builder-vector fixtures (1-input / 2-input / 3-input).
- [ ] **§3.3 (b) revised.** `SignedProofs.commitments` and
      `SignedProofs.enc_amounts` are byte-identical to a legacy-
      path parallel call; randomized components verify.
- [ ] **§3.3 (c) preserved.** Test runs in <1 s.
- [ ] Cross-reference appended to migration plan §3.3.
- [ ] CHANGELOG and FOLLOWUPS updated.

The first criterion in the migration plan ("Test passes against ≥3
existing `tx-builder` test vectors") is interpreted as "≥3
fixtures that look like tx-builder test vectors" — the actual
`tx_builder/src/tests.rs::dummy_*` fixtures are private to that
crate and cannot be reached from `local_keys.rs::tests`, so the
fixtures are inlined per §3.1’s adapter-helper disposition.

---

## §7 What this pre-flight does NOT address

- **PR 5’s `TxToSign` shape.** Pinned independently in PR 5’s
  design rounds (parallel track per
  [`STAGE_1_PR_4_REFRESH_ENGINE.md`](./STAGE_1_PR_4_REFRESH_ENGINE.md)
  and the 2026-05-10 sequencing decision).
- **Bridge from `KeyEngine::sign_transaction` to
  `tx_builder::sign_transaction`.** Lands in PR 5.
- **Integration-test re-location.** Lands at `KeyEngine` `pub`
  trigger; FOLLOWUPS entry tracks.
- **M3d / M3e.** Subsequent migration tail; M3c-via-C is the
  precondition.
