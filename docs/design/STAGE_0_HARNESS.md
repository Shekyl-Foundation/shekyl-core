# Stage 0 measurement harness — design

**Status.** Stage 0 PR-1 of the Stage 1 trait-extraction plan
(`docs/V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md` accepted at Round 5,
`e484d5041`, merged to `dev` at `40093ac7a`). This document is the
design contract that Stage 0 PR-2 implements.

The six decisions pinned below were named at category-level in the
trait spec and are pinned at implementation-level here. The Stage
0 PR-1 plan named them as the design surface; this document is
PR-1's deliverable.

---

## 1. Scope

The §3.3 *interior-mutability measurement gate* requires a
`criterion`-driven harness measuring read-path overhead on five
hot paths (named in §3.3.1) before any Stage 1 trait-extraction
PR lands. Stage 0 produces:

- A **frozen baseline** captured against the existing monolithic
  `Engine<S>` surface — what Stage 1 PRs measure their per-PR
  delta against.
- The **harness implementation** itself: bench files in
  `rust/shekyl-engine-core/benches/` and the wiring that lets the
  numbers reach reviewers during PR review.
- A **threshold sanity-check** confirming §3.3.1's 10% / 25%
  thresholds are coherent against measured run-to-run variance on
  the chosen runner.

This design doc pins how the harness is implemented; it does not
itself land any benches or numbers. PR-2 lands the implementation
against this design.

---

## 2. Relationship to `V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md` §3.3.1

This section consolidates the contract-vs-implementation
relationship between this design doc and the trait spec. It is
the single anchor reviewers should cite when asking "does this
design respect the spec?" or "does this design require a Round 6
spec amendment?"

### 2.1 Contract vs implementation

The trait-boundaries spec
([`V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md`](../V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md))
is the **contract**. This design doc is the **implementation
governance** that names how the §3.3.1 measurement gate plugs
into the existing repository infrastructure. The contract pins:

- *What* is measured (read-path overhead on five hot paths
  named in §3.3.1).
- *Against what* (a frozen baseline of the existing monolithic
  `Engine<S>`).
- *To what tolerance* (the 10% justification threshold and the
  25% optimization threshold from §3.3.1).
- *In what document* (`docs/PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`).

The contract does **not** pin: which CI workflow runs the
measurement, which runner the workflow uses, which classification
class the bench-comparison script routes the entries through,
whether the baseline is frozen or rolling at the workflow level,
or whether iai-callgrind or criterion is the gate metric. Those
are implementation choices, and they live in this document.

If something in this document appears to amend the contract, the
contract wins and this document is wrong. The amendment vehicle
is Round 6 of the trait spec, not a design-doc revision. The
current design (six decisions in §4 below) does not amend the
contract — every decision is an implementation choice within the
contract's degrees of freedom.

### 2.2 The "§3.3" overload — two different gates

The phrase "the §3.3 gate" is overloaded across the project:

- [`V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md`](../V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md)
  §3.3 (the *trait spec §3.3*) — the *interior-mutability
  measurement gate*. Thresholds: **>10% requires PR-description
  justification; >25% requires optimization before merge.**
  Scope: read-path overhead from Stage 1 trait-extraction's
  interior locks, measured against the monolithic-`Engine<S>`
  baseline.
- [`MID_REWIRE_HARDENING.md`](../MID_REWIRE_HARDENING.md) §3.3
  (the *hardening §3.3*) — the *CI integration spec* for the
  existing benchmark gate. Thresholds: `crypto_bench_*` ±5%
  warn / ±15% fail (bidirectional); `hot_path_bench_*` +5%
  warn / +15% fail (slowdown-only).

These are two different gates measuring two different things,
both implemented through the same `ci/benchmarks` workflow. This
document treats them as orthogonal: the trait-spec gate adds a
**new** threshold class (`engine_trait_bench_*`, see §4.2) to
the existing harness rather than replacing the existing classes.
Naming below disambiguates by prefixing the spec name (e.g.
*trait-spec §3.3.1*, *hardening §3.3*).

### 2.3 Spec-as-source-of-truth for thresholds

The 10% / 25% threshold values come from trait spec §3.3.1
verbatim. They are not negotiated in this design doc; they are
**inherited**. The new bench class's routing entry in
`scripts/bench/compare.py` cites trait spec §3.3.1 as the
source-of-truth for the values. If trait spec §3.3.1 is ever
amended (Round 6 or later), `compare.py`'s routing entry is
updated to match and a single in-place comment cross-references
the spec amendment.

The corollary: this design doc does not "set the thresholds." It
**implements** them. Future spec amendments propagate to the
implementation through the same channel as any other spec change
— a follow-up commit that updates the citing site.

### 2.4 This document is the source-of-truth for Stage 0 PR-2's scope

The original Stage 1 plan named Stage 0 PR-2's scope at task-list
level: "criterion benches for the five §3.3.1 hot paths." The
plan was written before this design doc existed and assumed
Stage 0 was building from an empty CI substrate. The pre-drafting
gap-check (see PR description) surfaced the existing
`ci/benchmarks` harness; the design doc's Decision 4 (Option A
— extend the existing harness) shifts Stage 0 PR-2's scope to
include iai-callgrind benches alongside criterion, plus
workflow/script edits.

**The design doc is now the source of truth for Stage 0 PR-2's
scope.** §5 below ("What Stage 0 PR-2 implements") enumerates
the concrete handoff list; the original plan's task-list wording
is superseded by §5. PR-2 reviewers verify against §5; the
plan's pre-design wording is historical context, not a checklist.

### 2.5 Round 6 disposition for this PR

The pre-drafting gap-check considered whether the existing-harness
finding warrants a Round 6 spec amendment to §3.3.1. Disposition:
**no Round 6 amendment is needed.** The §3.3.1 contract is
correct; only the implementation choices changed. The design doc
captures everything; the framing tightening of §3.3.1
Component 1 (timing of when the harness lands shifts from "first
Stage 1 PR" to "Stage 0 PR-2") is a single-line in-place edit
that lands in Stage 0 PR-2's commit, not as a separate spec
amendment (per the plan's Push 4 disposition: "framing tightening
not Round 6").

---

## 3. Substrate that already exists

The repository already carries a per-PR benchmark gate. Stage 0's
design works *with* this substrate, not around it.

| Surface | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow | [`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`](../../.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml) (`name: ci/benchmarks`) | Per-PR gate + rolling baseline updater |
| Capture script | [`scripts/bench/capture_rust_baseline.sh`](../../scripts/bench/capture_rust_baseline.sh) | Runs criterion + iai-callgrind, writes `shekyl_rust_v0.json` envelope |
| Comparator | [`scripts/bench/compare.py`](../../scripts/bench/compare.py) | Routes each iai entry through the threshold table; emits a verdict per bench |
| Comment renderer | [`scripts/bench/post_comment.py`](../../scripts/bench/post_comment.py) | Upserts the marker-keyed PR comment |
| Baseline storage | Orphan branch `bench-baseline` (never merged) | Single `baseline.json` at tip; refreshed on every push to `dev` that touches a benched path |
| Schema | `shekyl_rust_v0` (criterion entries + iai-callgrind entries + host manifest) | Stable across reference-machine swaps; bumps require manifest update |
| Manifest | [`docs/benchmarks/shekyl_rust_v0.manifest.md`](../benchmarks/shekyl_rust_v0.manifest.md) | Prose specification of every measured operation |

The existing harness uses **iai-callgrind `instructions`** as the
gate-tier metric, explicitly because cloud-runner wall-clock is
too noisy for percentage-threshold gating. Criterion wall-clock is
captured into the same envelope and rendered as informational rows
in the PR comment, but does not gate.

The watched-path list does **not** currently include
`rust/shekyl-engine-core/**`. Adding it is part of Stage 0 PR-2's
implementation work.

**`update-baseline` job behavior on PR-2's merge.** The
`update-baseline` job (gated on `push` to `dev`) runs against
PR-2's merge commit. Because PR-2 also lands the watched-path
addition for `rust/shekyl-engine-core/**`, the merge commit is
within scope; the job re-captures and absorbs the new
`engine_trait_bench_*` entries into `bench-baseline/baseline.json`.
Subsequent Stage 1 PR gates measure against this updated rolling
baseline; the §4.5 freeze-vs-rolling reconciliation depends on
this single absorption step.

---

## 4. Six decisions

The decisions that follow are pinned in the dependency order the
user-named drafting framework surfaced (Decision 6 frames the
measurement surface; the rest cascade). The reading order matches
the dependency order.

### 4.1 Decision 6 — Stage 0 ↔ Stage 4 forward-extension

**Decision.** Stage 0 measures **the today-equivalent call paths
through whatever surface exists at the baseline SHA** (typically
an `Engine<S>` accessor + inner-state method, e.g.,
`engine.ledger().compute_balance(...)`). The §3.3.1 trait-method
names (`KeyEngine::account_public_address`, `LedgerEngine::balance`,
etc.) are workload labels naming *which workloads to measure*,
not literal call-site requirements; the spec is silent on the
exact call-site shape at Stage 0 because the trait extraction is
Stage 1's substantive deliverable. Stage 1 per-trait PRs migrate
each bench's call site from the today-equivalent path to the
**trait-method path** as part of the per-trait extraction work.
Stage 4 actor-backed implementations inherit the same
trait-surface benches with no harness code change; the runtime
cost shifts (mailbox round-trip + actor handler) but the measured
surface is invariant.

**Why this framing matters.** A naïve framing — "Stage 0 must
ship trait-surface-shaped benches from the start so they're
forward-compatible" — is not implementable, because the traits
don't exist yet at Stage 0. (The trait extractions *are* Stage 1.)
The honest framing is: forward-compatibility is a property of the
**migration path**, not of Stage 0's bench surface in isolation.
Stage 0's benches measure what exists now; Stage 1 PRs migrate
the call site as part of the same PR that introduces the trait;
Stage 4 inherits unchanged.

**Implementation hooks.** Each bench file's measured-surface
comment records what surface it currently calls (the
today-equivalent call path at Stage 0, e.g.,
`engine.ledger().compute_balance(...)`; the trait method on
`Engine<S, …>` after the relevant Stage 1 PR, e.g.,
`<Engine<…> as LedgerEngine>::balance(&engine, ...)`). The Stage 1
migration reshapes the bench's call site from the today-equivalent
path to the trait-method path — typically a few lines: accessor
disappears, inner-state call becomes trait dispatch. The fixture
is unchanged; the measured work is unchanged.

**Note on the today-equivalent call path.** Of the five §3.3.1
hot paths, **two** have today-equivalent call paths at the Stage 0
baseline SHA:

- `LedgerEngine::synced_height`: `Engine<S>::synced_height()` at
  `engine/merge.rs:86`. Direct call.
- `LedgerEngine::balance`: `engine.ledger().balance(synced_height)`
  through `LedgerBlockExt::balance` in
  `shekyl-scanner/src/ledger_ext.rs:166`, which dispatches to
  `BalanceSummary::compute(transfers, height)`. Accessor +
  extension trait + state-layer compute.

The other three (`KeyEngine::account_public_address`,
`EconomicsEngine::current_emission`,
`EconomicsEngine::parameters_snapshot`) **have no today-equivalent
call path** because the workloads they label do not exist as
identifiable units in the V3.0 codebase: `account_public_address`
exists in C++ FFI (`shekyl-ffi/src/account_ffi.rs`) and as
docstring references but no Rust function derives a wallet's
primary account public address from key material as a single
operation; `current_emission`'s components live in
`shekyl-economics` (`calc_release_multiplier`,
`split_block_emission`, `apply_release_multiplier`,
`calc_effective_emission_share`) but no aggregating
"emission at height H" function exists; `parameters_snapshot`'s
`EconomicParams` struct exists but no snapshot-constructor
operation does. Per §4.2's per-bench frozen-baseline framing,
those three benches are **deferred** to their respective Stage 1
per-trait PRs.

For the two Stage-0-frozen benches (where today-equivalent paths
exist), two alternatives were considered and rejected:

- **Add thin shim `pub fn` methods to `Engine<S>` at Stage 0
  with the trait-method names**, replaced by trait impls at
  Stage 1. Rejected on two grounds. First, it introduces public
  methods on `Engine<S>` whose only Stage-0 caller is the bench
  file, violating `15-deletion-and-debt.mdc`'s
  "no-code-with-bench-as-only-caller" rule (the shims would
  exist for one Stage 1 PR's lifetime each, then be replaced by
  trait-impl methods of the same name). Second, it dilutes
  Stage 1's first-class trait-introduction framing —
  per-trait PRs would read as "rename a method and add a trait
  declaration around it" rather than "introduce the abstraction
  surface, the impl, the type-parameter discipline." Reviewers
  would see a smaller-than-real change.
- **Extract the trait at Stage 0 (move trait-definition work
  from Stage 1 PR 1 into Stage 0 PR-2).** Rejected on its face:
  Stage 0 is the harness, Stage 1 is the trait extractions;
  mixing the two defeats the two-stage structure.

The accepted approach for the Stage-0-frozen pair
(today-equivalent call paths at Stage 0; trait dispatch at
Stage 1) produces a side-benefit: PR-2 discovers the
today-equivalent surface concretely as part of fixture authoring
(e.g., the `engine.ledger().balance(...)` dispatch path), which
is information Stage 1's per-trait PRs would otherwise have to
surface from scratch. For the deferred three, the per-trait PR
is itself the moment the workload first exists as a unit; the
bench is authored together with the trait method. The
disposition discussion (compose-inline vs introduce-helper vs
defer) for the deferred three lives in §4.2.

**Note on trait-method disambiguation.** Once a Stage 1 PR
introduces the trait, `Engine<S, …>` may carry both an inherent
method and a trait method with the same signature for the
trait's transitional period. Method-call syntax
(`engine.account_public_address(0, 0)`) resolves to the inherent
method when both exist, which would silently keep the bench on
the pre-migration surface. The migrating PR uses fully-qualified
trait dispatch (`<Engine<…> as KeyEngine>::account_public_address(&engine, 0, 0)`)
so the call site is unambiguous, and updates the bench file's
measured-surface comment to record which surface is in scope.
Reviewers verify the comment matches the actual call.

**Cross-reference.** §10.2.2 *Stage 4 cost characterization*
inherits this harness as-is at Stage 4 cutover. Comparison
baseline at that point is Stage-1-final numbers (post-last-per-trait-PR),
not the Stage 0 frozen baseline.

### 4.2 Decision 1 — Benchmark selection

**Decision.** Five hot paths from §3.3.1, each shipping **two
benches** (criterion + iai-callgrind sibling) following the
existing `MID_REWIRE_HARDENING.md` §3.2 tool split. New
threshold-routing class introduced for these benches:
`engine_trait_bench_*`. Per the per-bench frozen-baseline framing
below, **two** of the five pairs ship at Stage 0 PR-2 (the
Stage-0-frozen pair); the other **three** ship at their respective
Stage 1 per-trait PR (per §4.6's per-bench deferred assignment).
The `engine_trait_bench_*` class definition and the threshold
routing apply to all five regardless of which PR introduces them;
class membership is the unifying contract.

**Hot paths, bench filenames, iai routing function names, and
Stage 0 disposition:**

| Hot path | Bench file (criterion) | Bench file (iai-callgrind) | iai `#[library_benchmark]` function | Stage 0 disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `KeyEngine::account_public_address` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_key_account_public_address.rs` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_key_account_public_address_iai.rs` | `engine_trait_bench_key_account_public_address` | Deferred to KeyEngine PR |
| `LedgerEngine::balance` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance.rs` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance_iai.rs` | `engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance` | Stage-0-frozen |
| `LedgerEngine::synced_height` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_ledger_synced_height.rs` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_ledger_synced_height_iai.rs` | `engine_trait_bench_ledger_synced_height` | Stage-0-frozen |
| `EconomicsEngine::current_emission` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_economics_current_emission.rs` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_economics_current_emission_iai.rs` | `engine_trait_bench_economics_current_emission` | Deferred to EconomicsEngine PR |
| `EconomicsEngine::parameters_snapshot` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_economics_parameters_snapshot.rs` | `benches/engine_trait_bench_economics_parameters_snapshot_iai.rs` | `engine_trait_bench_economics_parameters_snapshot` | Deferred to EconomicsEngine PR |

Stage 0 PR-2 ships the two Stage-0-frozen pair (four bench files
total: two criterion + two iai-callgrind siblings); the three
deferred benches enter the harness at their respective Stage 1
per-trait PR (per §4.6's per-bench deferred assignment).

**Function-name routing discipline.** `compare.py`'s `classify()`
routes on the iai-callgrind `#[library_benchmark]` *function*
name, not the bench-target file name. Each new iai bench's
function must start with `engine_trait_bench_` — matching the
class name — or the entry lands in `unrouted` and the threshold
gate doesn't apply. The function name is what the existing
classes (`crypto_bench_*`, `hot_path_bench_*`) match against,
and the same convention extends to the new class without
infrastructure change. Reviewers verify the function name in
each new iai bench file matches the table above.

**Naming convention rationale.** The existing harness uses
`crypto_bench_*` (bidirectional) and `hot_path_bench_*`
(slowdown-only). The trait-spec measurement is **bidirectional**
(per `compare.py`'s pattern for `crypto_bench_*`): a +30% slowdown
is bad, and a -50% speed-up against the current monolithic engine
likely indicates the bench fixture broke or measured the wrong
work. A new prefix avoids redefining either of the two existing
classes' semantics.

**New threshold class:**

| Class | Warn | Fail | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| `engine_trait_bench_*` | ±10% | ±25% | **bidirectional** |

These are the trait-spec §3.3.1 thresholds verbatim, applied
bidirectionally for the same reason `crypto_bench_*` is
bidirectional.

**Per-bench frozen baseline.** The trait-spec §3.3.1 frozen
baseline is **per-bench**, not uniform across all five hot paths.
Each bench's frozen-baseline SHA is the SHA at which the bench's
measured workload first exists as an identifiable unit:

- **Stage-0-frozen benches** (`engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance`,
  `engine_trait_bench_ledger_synced_height`): frozen baseline
  captured at Stage 0 PR-2's merge SHA. The workload exists as a
  unit at Stage 0 (today-equivalent call path per §4.1); PR-2
  captures the iai-callgrind `instructions` and criterion
  `median_ns` numbers and freezes them.
- **Deferred benches** (`engine_trait_bench_key_account_public_address`,
  `engine_trait_bench_economics_current_emission`,
  `engine_trait_bench_economics_parameters_snapshot`): frozen
  baseline captured at the introducing Stage 1 per-trait PR's
  merge SHA. The workload first exists as a unit when the
  trait method is introduced; the per-trait PR introduces the
  bench alongside the method and freezes its baseline at that
  PR's merge SHA. Per §4.6's per-bench deferred assignment, the
  KeyEngine PR introduces the `account_public_address` bench and
  the EconomicsEngine PR introduces both economics benches.

Stage 1 PR descriptions cite cumulative delta against each
bench's frozen-baseline SHA (per §4.5's per-bench-SHA
disposition); the temporal anchor shifts per-bench, but the
§3.3.1 cumulative-budget contract applies uniformly per bench.

**Surface measured at Stage 0** (Stage-0-frozen pair only):
today-equivalent call path (per §4.1; for `synced_height`, direct
`Engine<S>` method; for `balance`, accessor + extension trait +
state-layer compute).
**Surface measured after the relevant Stage 1 PR** (any bench in
scope at that PR): trait method through
`<Engine<S, …> as TraitName>` dispatch. The fixture is identical
across the migration; the call site reshapes (per §4.1's
*Implementation hooks*).

**Why the deferred three are deferred.** The Stage 0 PR-2
pre-drafting gap-check found that three of the five §3.3.1 hot
paths label workloads that do not exist as identifiable units in
the V3.0 codebase (per §4.1's enumeration:
`account_public_address`, `current_emission`,
`parameters_snapshot`). Three options to close the gap were
considered:

- **Compose the today-equivalent inline in the Stage 0 bench
  file.** The bench's setup composes the underlying functions
  into the workload; the measured region calls the composition.
  Rejected: the Stage 0 composition may not match what Stage 1's
  trait impl actually does. If they diverge, the cumulative-delta
  number against the Stage 0 baseline compares different
  workloads — a number that looks legitimate but isn't.
  Mitigation via "may re-baseline at Stage 1" weakens the §3.3.1
  frozen-baseline contract for 60% of its rows; the
  cumulative-delta semantics depend on the baseline being stable.
- **Introduce helper functions in inner-state crates at Stage 0**
  (e.g., `pub fn current_emission(...)` in `shekyl-economics`,
  `pub fn primary_account_address(...)` in the keys layer). The
  bench calls the helper; Stage 1's trait impl wraps it.
  Rejected on the same grounds as §4.1's shim alternative,
  displaced to a different crate. The
  "no-code-with-bench-as-only-caller" rule from
  `15-deletion-and-debt.mdc` is not Engine-specific. Worse on a
  subtler axis: at the inner-state layer, the helpers read as
  plausible APIs (someone might want `current_emission(height)`
  outside the trait context), which makes them harder to remove
  when Stage 1's trait-impl duplicates them. Inner-state crates
  accumulate near-duplicate API surface; nobody cleans up
  because "maybe someone uses it."
- **Defer to the introducing per-trait PR** (selected). The
  Stage 1 per-trait PR is the moment the workload first exists
  as a unit; that PR introduces both the trait method and the
  bench, with the bench's frozen baseline captured at the PR's
  merge SHA. The §3.3.1 spec's "at minimum" wording allows
  reviewer judgment to defer specific paths; this option uses
  that allowance, and is consistent with §4.6's general
  "bench-with-method PR" discipline applied to Stage 1's
  surface-introduction PRs.

The selected approach is honest about what Stage 0 measures
(today-equivalent paths for the two hot paths whose workload
exists; capture-when-real for the three whose workload arrives
later) and preserves the §3.3.1 cumulative-delta semantics
uniformly per bench (the temporal anchor shifts; the contract
shape is the same).

**Fixture shape (qualitative).** Each bench constructs an
`Engine<S>` with a pre-populated state mimicking a typical wallet
workload:

- A `transfers` vec sized to a representative workload (single
  digits of thousands of entries; specific count derived in PR-2).
- Pre-derived `account_public_address` (single read, no derivation
  in the measured region).
- Mock daemon (no network I/O in the measured region; daemon RPC
  is not on these read paths anyway).
- No filesystem I/O in the measured region.

**Stage 0 PR-1 scope guard.** This document does **not** pin
specific entry counts or fixture sizes. Pinning numbers here
would create synthetic precision the design cannot justify
(actual entry counts are an empirical question PR-2 answers
during fixture derivation). However, the manifest is required
to make the derivation auditable:

- **Manifest requirement.** Each bench's manifest section
  documents specific entry counts, account counts, output counts,
  and block heights, **with derivation rationale** (one or two
  sentences naming the user-population shape the fixture
  represents).
- **Reviewer gate.** Reviewers verify the manifest's derivation
  rationale produces a workload **representative of a typical
  user wallet at six months of normal use**. The criterion is
  representativeness, not specific numerical targets.
- **Why this matters.** Fixture shape is load-bearing for
  threshold sanity. iai-callgrind's `instructions` is largely
  insensitive to working-set size (cache misses don't add
  instructions), but criterion `median_ns` is highly sensitive
  to whether the fixture fits in L2/L3 cache. A fixture chosen
  to "fit nicely" would understate real-world cost; a fixture
  chosen for "stress test" would overstate it.
- **Cross-bench surface distinction.** When a bench measures an
  engine-surface call that dispatches to an existing
  state-layer bench's measured operation (e.g.,
  `engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance` measures the engine
  surface whose underlying compute is also benched by
  `shekyl-engine-state`'s `hot_path_bench_balance_compute`),
  the manifest entry names both benches and explains the
  surface distinction. The engine-surface cost is gate-class
  `engine_trait_bench_*` (bidirectional ±10% / ±25%); the
  state-layer cost remains gate-class `hot_path_bench_*`
  (slowdown-only +5% / +15%). The two benches are not redundant
  — they measure different layers of the same logical
  operation — but reviewers should be able to find that
  distinction without reconstructing it.

PR-2 lands the fixture along with the bench files; reviewers
gate the manifest's representativeness rationale separately
from this design.

### 4.3 Decision 2 — Baseline statistics

**Decision.** Two-tier metric, mirroring the existing harness:

- **Tier 1 (gate):** iai-callgrind `instructions`. Single
  deterministic value per bench; identical across runs on the
  same host (Valgrind does not introduce variance).
- **Tier 2 (informational):** criterion `median_ns` (printed in
  PR comment), with `mean_ns` and `std_dev_ns` carried for
  completeness in the JSON envelope. Not gated.

**Why median over mean for criterion.** The existing harness's
`compare.py` uses `median_ns` for criterion's informational
column because median is robust to outlier samples (background
GC pause, runner scheduling tick); mean is included alongside
for human triage when a regression appears.

**`PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` content.** The human-readable
baseline document carries:

- Per hot path: iai-callgrind `instructions` (single value),
  criterion `median_ns` and `mean_ns` (typical run on the
  reference runner).
- Host manifest: CPU model, kernel, rustc version, criterion
  version, iai-callgrind-runner version, valgrind version, build
  profile (`--release` with workspace defaults).
- Capture-time SHA on `dev`: the SHA at which the frozen baseline
  was measured.

**Sample size.** Criterion default (100 samples) — same as the
existing harness. iai-callgrind runs are single-shot per bench
(deterministic); no sample-size concept applies.

**Threshold disposition.** Per Tier 1 gate-metric choice:
percentage delta on `instructions` is the canonical signal for
the trait-spec §3.3.1 thresholds. The Tier 2 criterion `median_ns`
delta is a secondary check for cache-behavior-sensitive
regressions that the instruction count would not detect; it is
informational only and does not gate (matching the existing
harness's discipline).

### 4.4 Decision 3 — Environmental variance handling

**Decision.** **`ubuntu-latest` GHA runner** for the gate, same as
the existing harness. Determinism comes from iai-callgrind's
deterministic `instructions` metric, not from the runner. Cloud
runners' wall-clock variance is treated as expected for the Tier
2 informational column.

**Why this is sufficient.** The trait-spec §3.3.1 thresholds (10%,
25%) are calibrated to "typical criterion noise floor (1–3% under
good conditions)." On `ubuntu-latest` the criterion noise floor
is materially higher (5–15% common). Three options to reconcile:

1. **Use iai-callgrind for the gate** (selected). iai-callgrind's
   `instructions` is deterministic on shared runners; the 10% /
   25% thresholds are coherent against ±0% variance.
2. **Use a dedicated bench host.** Lower noise floor on criterion
   wall-clock; cost ~$30/mo cloud or zero on self-hosted with
   maintainer-approval gating. Tracked as a future Tier-2 upgrade
   in [`MID_REWIRE_HARDENING.md`](../MID_REWIRE_HARDENING.md) §6.1.
3. **Loosen the trait-spec thresholds** to absorb runner variance.
   Rejected: trait-spec §3.3.1 names the 10% / 25% values as the
   substantive threshold, not an artifact of measurement
   environment. Loosening to fit a noisy runner conflates "the
   change cost N%" with "the runner happened to vary by N%."

**Threshold sanity-check (Stage 0 PR-2 part 4).** Re-run
iai-callgrind across N runs on `ubuntu-latest`. **Confirm**
variance is ±0% (Valgrind is deterministic for typical code);
do not assert it. The known exception is hardware-RNG
instructions (e.g., `RDRAND`) — Valgrind models them
non-deterministically across runs, which leaks into the
measured `instructions` count. None of the five hot paths
(`balance`, `synced_height`, `current_emission`,
`parameters_snapshot`, `account_public_address`) should hit
hardware RNG on the read path; if non-zero variance appears,
the most likely cause is fixture setup leaking RNG-using code
into the measured region, indicating the fixture build needs
to move outside the bench's measured `iai_benchmark!` block.
Re-run criterion across N runs; record the wall-clock variance
for the host manifest. The sanity-check confirms the gate-metric
is coherent against the thresholds; it does not aim to prove
criterion wall-clock is precise (it isn't, on shared runners).

**If criterion variance is unexpectedly high on the gate-metric
benches.** PR-2 may surface a small framing tightening to
trait-spec §3.3.1 (single-line clarifying that criterion
wall-clock is informational and the 10%/25% thresholds apply to
the gate-metric). Per the plan's Push 4 disposition: this lands
as a standalone spec amendment in Stage 0 PR-2, *not* §8.2
co-landing with Stage 1 PR 1.

### 4.5 Decision 4 — CI integration

**Decision.** **Extend** the existing `ci/benchmarks` harness;
do not run a parallel harness. The trait-spec §3.3.1 hot paths
land as new entries in the existing capture/compare/comment
pipeline, gated through the new `engine_trait_bench_*` class.

**Concrete changes Stage 0 PR-2 makes:**

1. **Watched paths.** Add `rust/shekyl-engine-core/**` to the
   `paths:` list in
   [`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`](../../.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml)
   for both `pull_request` and `push` triggers. Without this, PRs
   touching `shekyl-engine-core` do not trigger the gate.

   **Stage 0 PR-2's own gate run on first introduction.** PR-2
   touches both watched paths and `scripts/bench/` (routing
   entries) and adds the bench files in the same commit, so the
   `pull_request` gate runs on PR-2 itself and encounters the new
   `engine_trait_bench_*` entries with no baseline counterpart.
   The existing `compare.py` (lines 165–255) routes such entries
   into the `added_in_pr` list, which is **informational**:
   `has_fail = (fail > 0) OR bool(missing_in_pr)`, so added
   entries do **not** trip the gate. This is also documented in
   [`docs/benchmarks/README.md`](../benchmarks/README.md):
   "An entry present in the PR but not the baseline is
   informational; the first merge to `dev` seeds it into the
   rolling baseline." On PR-2's merge to `dev`, the
   `update-baseline` job absorbs the new entries into
   `bench-baseline/baseline.json`. From the next Stage 1 PR
   onward, the gate runs against the seeded rolling baseline.

   No additional first-commit-with-placeholder-baselines step is
   required; the existing harness handles new-bench introduction
   correctly without it.
2. **Capture script.** Add **two** rows to the `BENCHES` array in
   [`scripts/bench/capture_rust_baseline.sh`](../../scripts/bench/capture_rust_baseline.sh)
   for the Stage-0-frozen pair, following the existing
   `crate:criterion-target:iai-callgrind-target` shape. Each
   Stage-0-frozen bench compiles to its own criterion +
   iai-callgrind sibling pair under the new naming convention.
   Each Stage 1 per-trait PR that introduces a deferred bench
   appends its own `BENCHES` row at that PR.
3. **Compare classifier.** Add a third branch to the `classify()`
   function in
   [`scripts/bench/compare.py`](../../scripts/bench/compare.py)
   matching `engine_trait_bench_*`, with `verdict_for()` extended
   to apply the bidirectional ±10% warn / ±25% fail thresholds.
   The classifier change covers all five benches by class
   membership; per-trait PRs introducing deferred benches do not
   need to touch the classifier.
4. **PR-comment surface.** No change. The existing
   `post_comment.py` renders all entries from the report; new
   entries appear automatically.
5. **Manifest extension.** Add a new section to
   [`docs/benchmarks/shekyl_rust_v0.manifest.md`](../benchmarks/shekyl_rust_v0.manifest.md)
   for each of the **two Stage-0-frozen benches**, following the
   existing manifest section template (operation list, fixture
   shape, known gaps). Add **three placeholder sections** for the
   deferred benches naming the target Stage 1 per-trait PR (per
   §4.6's per-bench deferred assignment); each per-trait PR
   replaces its placeholder section with the populated content
   when the deferred bench enters the harness.

**Freeze-vs-rolling baseline reconciliation.** Trait-spec §3.3.1
requires a **frozen** baseline (per-bench, per §4.2's per-bench
frozen-baseline framing — Stage 0 PR-2's SHA for the
Stage-0-frozen pair; the introducing per-trait PR's SHA for the
three deferred benches), unchanged through all Stage 1 PRs after
each bench's introducing SHA. The existing `bench-baseline` is
**rolling**, refreshed on every push to `dev`. Two readings of
"the per-PR delta" coexist:

- **CI-gate delta** (rolling): each PR's iai-callgrind delta
  against `bench-baseline/baseline.json` at the moment the gate
  runs. This is what the workflow enforces. As Stage 1 PRs land
  on `dev`, each subsequent PR's gate runs against the previous
  PR's post-merge state (the rolling baseline). The gate catches
  per-PR regressions but does not show cumulative delta across
  all Stage 1 PRs.
- **Cumulative-delta citation** (frozen, per-bench): each Stage
  1 PR's description cites both numbers — the CI-gate delta
  against the rolling baseline (gated; what the workflow says),
  and the cumulative delta against
  [`docs/PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`](../PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md)'s
  frozen numbers (citation only; what reviewers consult for "did
  the trait extraction as a whole stay within budget"). Per
  §4.2's per-bench frozen-baseline framing, the frozen-baseline
  SHA is **per-bench**:
  - **Stage 0 PR-2's merge SHA** for the two Stage-0-frozen
    benches (`engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance`,
    `engine_trait_bench_ledger_synced_height`).
  - **The introducing per-trait PR's merge SHA** for the three
    deferred benches: KeyEngine PR's SHA for
    `engine_trait_bench_key_account_public_address`;
    EconomicsEngine PR's SHA for
    `engine_trait_bench_economics_current_emission` and
    `engine_trait_bench_economics_parameters_snapshot`.

  The §3.3.1 cumulative-delta contract ("no extraction adds more
  than 25% read-path overhead, cumulatively, across Stage 1")
  applies per-bench: for each bench, "cumulatively" sums the
  deltas across all Stage 1 PRs starting from the bench's
  introducing SHA. The temporal anchor shifts per-bench; the
  contract shape is uniform. Stage 1 PR descriptions list one
  cumulative-delta line per bench currently in scope at that PR,
  each citing the bench's specific frozen-baseline SHA.

Why both. The CI gate is the per-PR enforcement signal; it
catches a single PR introducing a >25% regression even if prior
PRs were fine. The frozen-baseline citation is the trait-spec
§3.3.1 cumulative-delta signal; it catches "each PR added 5%, the
last one tripped 25% over Stage 0 baseline" patterns. Both are
necessary; they answer different questions.

`PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`'s post-interior-lock table
(per-Stage-1-PR delta column) records the frozen-baseline delta
each PR introduces, computed against each bench's frozen numbers
(per the per-bench-SHA disposition above; Stage 0 PR-2's SHA for
the Stage-0-frozen pair, the introducing per-trait PR's SHA for
the deferred three). Reviewers cite the table during Stage 1 PR
review; the document is the canonical source of cumulative delta.

**Worked example, Stage-0-frozen bench (illustrative).** Suppose
the cumulative deltas are tracked for `engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance`
across Stage 1. PR 1 (DaemonEngine) lands at +5% against
PR-2's frozen baseline; PR 2 (LedgerEngine) adds another +6%
against the post-PR-1 rolling baseline (which is +5% above
frozen, so PR 2's cumulative is +11%); PR 3 (KeyEngine) lands at
+4% rolling, +15% cumulative. Stage 1 PR 3's description reads:
"CI-gate delta against rolling baseline: +4% (passes ±10% warn,
±25% fail). Cumulative delta against
`engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance` frozen baseline at Stage 0
PR-2's SHA: +15% (between 10% warn threshold and 25% fail
threshold; justification per trait-spec §3.3.1: combined
trait-dispatch overhead is within budgeted total)." Both numbers
cited; the gate enforces the rolling delta; the cumulative number
is visible to reviewers without requiring a separate computation.
Stage 1 PR 4's description, in turn, cites its own +N% (rolling)
and the new running cumulative against the same frozen baseline.

**Worked example, deferred bench (illustrative).** Suppose
EconomicsEngine PR is Stage 1 PR 4. PR 4 introduces both the
trait methods (`current_emission`, `parameters_snapshot`) and
the two new benches (`engine_trait_bench_economics_current_emission`,
`engine_trait_bench_economics_parameters_snapshot`). PR 4's CI
gate runs against the rolling baseline, encounters the new
entries with no baseline counterpart, and routes them into
`added_in_pr` (informational; non-gating per §4.5 item 1). PR
4's description cites cumulative delta against PR 4's own merge
SHA, which is **zero by definition**: the bench just got
introduced. After PR 4 merges, `update-baseline` seeds the new
entries into `bench-baseline/baseline.json`. Stage 1 PR 5
(suppose RefreshEngine) re-runs the deferred benches against the
seeded rolling baseline and cites their cumulative delta against
PR 4's SHA — a non-zero number for the first time. The
Stage-0-frozen benches' cumulative-delta numbers in PR 5's
description still cite Stage 0 PR-2's SHA per the per-bench-SHA
disposition. PR 5's description carries up to five
cumulative-delta lines (one per bench currently in scope), each
against its bench's specific frozen-baseline SHA: two against
PR-2, two against PR 4 (EconomicsEngine PR), and — once the
KeyEngine PR has landed — one against the KeyEngine PR's SHA.

**Why not lock the rolling baseline during Stage 1.** Plausible
alternative: suspend `update-baseline` for `shekyl-engine-core`
benches during Stage 1 (lock the baseline at Stage 0 PR-2's SHA
until the last per-trait PR lands; resume rolling refresh
after). Implementable via a path-filter on the `update-baseline`
job, but adds workflow complexity and creates a Stage-1-specific
exception in the otherwise-uniform rolling baseline. Both
readings of "per-PR delta" are useful to reviewers; the simpler
implementation (rolling baseline + frozen-baseline citation in
PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md) preserves both signals.

**Existing-class alternative considered and rejected.** Routing
the new benches under the existing `hot_path_bench_*` class
(slowdown-only, +5% / +15%) would be simpler workflow-wise but
loses two properties trait-spec §3.3.1 requires: bidirectional
detection (a -50% speed-up flags a broken fixture, not a real
optimization, on engine read paths) and the looser 10% / 25%
thresholds (orchestration overhead is reasonably allowed more
runtime cost than a tight crypto inner loop). The new class is
necessary, not gratuitous.

### 4.6 Decision 5 — Harness update discipline

**Decision.** New benches enter the harness **as part of the PR
that introduces the new measured surface**. New crates enter the
watched paths **as part of the same PR**.

**Stage 1 per-trait PRs.** Each Stage 1 PR (DaemonEngine,
LedgerEngine, …) owns the migration of its benched methods from
the inherent-method call site to the trait-method call site. The
PR also owns the manifest update and any threshold-class
adjustment if needed for that trait's specific surface.

**Per-bench deferred assignment.** Per §4.2's per-bench
frozen-baseline framing, three of the §3.3.1 hot paths defer
their bench introduction to their per-trait PR (because the
workload doesn't exist as a unit at Stage 0; see §4.1's "Note on
the today-equivalent call path"). Explicit assignment:

- **KeyEngine PR** introduces
  `engine_trait_bench_key_account_public_address` (criterion +
  iai-callgrind sibling) along with the trait method. The bench's
  frozen baseline is captured at the KeyEngine PR's merge SHA per
  §4.5's per-bench-SHA disposition.
- **EconomicsEngine PR** introduces both
  `engine_trait_bench_economics_current_emission` and
  `engine_trait_bench_economics_parameters_snapshot` (criterion +
  iai-callgrind sibling for each, four bench files total) along
  with the trait methods. Both benches' frozen baselines are
  captured at the EconomicsEngine PR's merge SHA.

The bench-with-method discipline (this section's general rule)
applies uniformly: the per-trait PR is the surface introduction
and carries the bench. Each per-trait PR's threshold sanity-check
(per §4.4 / §5) covers its newly-introduced bench(es) at the
PR's merge SHA, mirroring Stage 0 PR-2's sanity-check for the
Stage-0-frozen pair. Each per-trait PR's
`PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` update converts the placeholder rows
seeded by Stage 0 PR-2 (formatted as "deferred to: KeyEngine PR"
or "deferred to: EconomicsEngine PR") into populated rows with
the captured numbers and the PR's merge SHA.

**Stage 2+ method additions.** When a future PR adds a new
hot-path method to an existing trait, that PR adds the bench
alongside the method. Reviewer responsibility: flag any new
method on **the trait surfaces named in
[`V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md`](../V3_ENGINE_TRAIT_BOUNDARIES.md)
§3** (currently `KeyEngine`, `LedgerEngine`, `EconomicsEngine`,
`DaemonEngine`, `RefreshEngine`, `PendingTxEngine`,
`PersistenceEngine`; subject to refinement during Stage 1 if a
per-trait extraction surfaces a justified split or rename) that
does not have an accompanying bench, on the same justification
as the trait-spec §3.3.1 gate (read-path overhead must be
measured before merge). The spec is the source of truth for
the trait list; this design's enumeration is convenience for
current readers.

**Stage 4 cutover.** The harness measures the trait surface,
which is invariant across Stage 1 ↔ Stage 4 (per spec §7
invariants). Bench code is unchanged at cutover; the comparison
baseline shifts from Stage-0-frozen to Stage-1-final-frozen for
§10.2.2 cost characterization (per Decision 6).

**V3.1 multisig (§10.3.1) and beyond.** New hot paths introduced
by V3.1+ work follow the same discipline: bench-with-method PR.
The trait-spec gate's category-level pinning (read-path
overhead) remains the contract; the specific bench list grows
through the existing manifest discipline.

**Schema bumps.** Per
[`docs/benchmarks/README.md`](../benchmarks/README.md), schema
bumps to `shekyl_rust_v0.json` are required when a bench's
operation list, fixture shape, or measurement boundary changes.
The trait-spec hot paths use the same schema; adding entries does
not require a schema bump (rows are additive). Migrating from
inherent-method to trait-method during a Stage 1 PR is a
**measurement-boundary change** (different surface, same fixture)
and requires a schema bump per the existing discipline. The
schema bump goes in the same Stage 1 PR that does the migration.

**Manifest stewardship.** The five `engine_trait_bench_*` sections
in `shekyl_rust_v0.manifest.md` are owned by the trait-extraction
work for the duration of Stage 1 — Stage 0 PR-2 seeds two
populated sections (Stage-0-frozen pair) and three placeholder
sections (deferred); each Stage 1 per-trait PR converts its
placeholder section(s) to populated content per §4.6's per-bench
deferred assignment. After Stage 1 closes, ownership transfers to
whoever maintains the trait surface (default: the engine-core
crate maintainers; not a named role at V3.0).

## 5. What Stage 0 PR-2 implements

Concrete handoff list, in commit order. Each item is a checkbox
PR-2 reviewers verify against this design:

- [ ] **Two** criterion bench files (Stage-0-frozen pair, per
      §4.2's per-bench frozen-baseline framing) under
      `rust/shekyl-engine-core/benches/`:
      `engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance.rs`,
      `engine_trait_bench_ledger_synced_height.rs`
      (today-equivalent call sites per §4.1).
- [ ] **Two** iai-callgrind sibling bench files under
      `rust/shekyl-engine-core/benches/`:
      `engine_trait_bench_ledger_balance_iai.rs`,
      `engine_trait_bench_ledger_synced_height_iai.rs`
      (same call sites, deterministic instruction counts).
- [ ] `[[bench]]` entries for the Stage-0-frozen pair (four total
      entries: two criterion + two iai-callgrind) in
      `rust/shekyl-engine-core/Cargo.toml` (`harness = false` per
      the existing convention).
- [ ] **Two** new sections in
      `docs/benchmarks/shekyl_rust_v0.manifest.md` documenting
      operation list, fixture shape, known gaps for each
      Stage-0-frozen bench. **Three** placeholder sections marked
      as deferred with target Stage 1 per-trait PR named (per
      §4.6's per-bench deferred assignment): KeyEngine PR for
      `account_public_address`; EconomicsEngine PR for
      `current_emission` and `parameters_snapshot`.
- [ ] `BENCHES` array extension in
      `scripts/bench/capture_rust_baseline.sh` for the
      Stage-0-frozen pair (four target lines).
- [ ] `classify()` + `verdict_for()` extension in
      `scripts/bench/compare.py` for the new
      `engine_trait_bench_*` class.
- [ ] `paths:` extension in `.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`
      for `rust/shekyl-engine-core/**` (both `pull_request` and
      `push` triggers).
- [ ] **Workflow-dispatch enablement on `capture-pr` job.** Add
      `|| github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'` to the
      `capture-pr` job's `if:` gate in
      [`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`](../../.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml).
      The trigger is already declared at the workflow level
      (`workflow_dispatch:`) but no job currently runs on
      dispatch; this enables the (iii) capture mechanism below.
- [ ] **Frozen baseline captured on the reference runner before
      review** (Stage-0-frozen pair only). PR-2 author triggers a
      one-shot `workflow_dispatch` against PR-2's branch (a fresh
      `ubuntu-latest` GHA runner per the §4.4 reference
      environment); downloads the `shekyl_rust_v0.json` artifact;
      transcribes the iai-callgrind `instructions` and criterion
      `median_ns` / `mean_ns` numbers for the **two
      Stage-0-frozen benches** into
      `docs/PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` along with the host manifest
      and the SHA at which the capture ran; commits before
      opening PR-2 for review. **Three placeholder rows** in
      `PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` are seeded marking the deferred
      benches with their target per-trait PR named (per §4.6's
      per-bench deferred assignment); the rows convert from
      placeholder to populated when each per-trait PR captures
      its own frozen baseline at its merge SHA. The CI gate on
      PR-2 itself verifies the Stage-0-frozen numbers match:
      iai-callgrind to deterministic tolerance (±0% modulo the
      §4.4 hardware-RNG exception), criterion to within the
      documented variance. Drift beyond tolerance is grounds for
      re-running the capture.
- [ ] Single-line in-place tightening of trait-spec §3.3.1
      Component 1 placeholder to name Stage 0 PR-2's SHA and
      this design doc as the harness's design contract. This is
      contextual tightening (timing-of-when-harness-lands shifts
      from "first Stage 1 PR" to "Stage 0 PR-2"); the substantive
      §3.3.1 content is unchanged.
- [ ] **Threshold sanity-check: iai-callgrind determinism**
      (Stage-0-frozen pair). Re-run iai-callgrind N times across a
      fresh `ubuntu-latest` runner for the two Stage-0-frozen
      benches; confirm variance is ±0% and record the result in
      the `PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` host manifest. Non-zero
      variance triggers fixture-setup investigation per §4.4
      (most likely cause: hardware-RNG instruction leakage into
      the measured region). The deferred three benches' sanity-
      checks are carried out at their respective per-trait PRs
      per §4.6's per-bench deferred assignment.
- [ ] **Threshold sanity-check: criterion variance documentation**
      (Stage-0-frozen pair). Re-run criterion N times across a
      fresh `ubuntu-latest` runner for the two Stage-0-frozen
      benches; document the wall-clock variance (median, mean,
      std-dev) in the `PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` host manifest.
      Criterion is informational; the documentation is for
      reviewers comparing future per-PR criterion deltas against
      noise floor. Per the per-bench framing, each per-trait PR
      that introduces a deferred bench documents its own variance
      at that PR's merge SHA.
- [ ] **Conditional: standalone §3.3.1 tightening commit.** If
      the criterion variance documentation surfaces a §3.3.1
      framing issue (e.g., the spec's threshold framing reads
      ambiguously about whether 10%/25% applies to gate-metric
      or wall-clock), ship a **standalone** spec-amendment
      commit alongside PR-2 with the framing tightening — per
      Push 4 disposition, this is **never** §8.2 co-landed with
      Stage 1 PR 1. If criterion surfaces no framing issue,
      this checkbox is "N/A — no tightening needed" and the
      commit is omitted.

PR-2 does not modify trait-spec §3.3 substantive content; only
the in-place placeholder tightening at Component 1 is permitted,
and that's framing, not substance.
